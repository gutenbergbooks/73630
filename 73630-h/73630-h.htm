<p><em>Unlike most of the early romantic writers
of Germany, Zschokke is still read in his own
country and abroad. He was born in Magdeburg
in 1771 and died in 1848, honored throughout
Germany as liberal and patriot during the
Napoleonic wars.</em></p>

<p><em>After a sojourn in Switzerland as head of
the Department of Education in the Canton
of Grisons and later of the Department of
Forests and Mines in the Canton of Aargau,
he began to devote himself more exclusively
to literature, producing with amazing versatility
a great number of works on religion,
history, politics, and the drama. But popularity
came to him through his charming short stories,
written in a rather loose and careless style,
but full of vivacity, imagination, humor, and
a broad knowledge of life and character.
Many years of literary sifting have proved
“The Adventures of a New-Year’s Eve” and
“The Broken Cup” to be the most enduring
and popular of his short stories.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Author’s Note.</span>—There is extant under this name a short
piece by the author of “Little Kate of Heilbronn.” That and the
tale which here follows originated in an incident which took
place at Bern in the year 1802. Henry Von Kleist and Ludwig
Wieland, the son of the poet, were both friends of the writer,
in whose chamber hung an engraving called <em>La Cruche Cassée</em>,
the persons and contents of which resembled the scene set forth
below, under the head of The Tribunal. The drawing, which
was full of expression, gave great delight to those who saw it,
and led to many conjectures as to its meaning. The three friends
agreed, in sport, that they would each one day commit to writing
his peculiar interpretation of its design. Wieland promised
a satire; Von Kleist threw off a comedy; and the author of the
following tale what is here given.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2">That Napoule is only a very little place on
the bay of Cannes is true; yet it is pretty
well known through all Provence. It lies in
the shade of lofty evergreen palms, and darker orange
trees; but that alone would not make it renowned.
Still they say that there are grown the most luscious
grapes, the sweetest roses, and the handsomest girls.
I don’t know but it is so; in the mean time I believe it
most readily. Pity that Napoule is so small, and can
not produce more luscious grapes, fragrant roses, and
handsome maidens; especially, as we might then have
some of them transplanted to our own country.</p>

<p>As, ever since the foundation of Napoule, all the
Napoulese women have been beauties, so the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</span>Marietta was a wonder of wonders, as the chronicles
of the place declare. She was called the little Marietta;
yet she was not smaller than a girl of seventeen
or thereabout ought to be, seeing that her forehead
just reached up to the lips of a grown man.</p>

<p>The chronicles aforesaid had very good ground for
speaking of Marietta. I, had I stood in the shoes of
the chronicler, would have done the same. For Marietta,
who until lately had lived with her mother Manon
at Avignon, when she came back to her birthplace,
quite upset the whole village. Verily, not the houses,
but the people and their heads; and not the heads of
all the people, but of those particularly whose heads
and hearts are always in danger when in the neighborhood
of two bright eyes. I know very well that such
a position is no joke.</p>

<p>Mother Manon would have done much better if she
had remained at Avignon. But she had been left a
small inheritance, by which she received at Napoule an
estate consisting of some vine-hills, and a house that
lay in the shadow of a rock, between certain olive
trees and African acacias. This is a kind of thing
which no unprovided widow ever rejects; and, accordingly,
in her own estimation, she was as rich and happy
as though she were the Countess of Provence or something
like it.</p>

<p>So much the worse was it for the good people of
Napoule. They never suspected their misfortune, not
having read in Homer how a single pretty woman had
filled all Greece and Lesser Asia with discord and war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Marietta had scarcely been fourteen days in the
house, between the olive trees and the African acacias,
before every young man of Napoule knew that she
lived there, and that there lived not, in all Provence,
a more charming girl than the one in that house.</p>

<p>Went she through the village, sweeping lightly along
like a dressed-up angel, her frock, with its pale-green
bodice, and orange leaves and rosebuds upon the bosom
of it, fluttering in the breeze, and flowers and ribbons
waving about the straw bonnet, which shaded her beautiful
features—yes, then the grave old men spake out,
and the young ones were struck dumb. And everywhere,
to the right and left, little windows and doors
were opened with a “Good morning,” or a “Good
evening, Marietta,” as it might be, while she nodded
to the right and left with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>If Marietta walked into church, all hearts (that is,
of the young people) forgot Heaven; all eyes turned
from the saints, and the worshiping finger wandered
idly among the pearls of the rosary. This must certainly
have provoked much sorrow, at least, among the
more devout.</p>

<p>The maidens of Napoule particularly became very
pious about this time, for they, most of all, took the
matter to heart. And they were not to be blamed for
it; for since the advent of Marietta more than one
prospective groom had become cold, and more than
one worshiper of some beloved one quite inconstant.
There were bickerings and reproaches on all sides,
many tears, pertinent lectures, and even rejections.
The talk was no longer of marriages, but of separations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</span>
They began to return their pledges of troth,
rings, ribbons, etc. The old persons took part with
their children; criminations and strife spread from
house to house; it was most deplorable.</p>

<p>Marietta is the cause of all, said the pious maidens
first; then the mothers said it; next the fathers took it
up; and finally all—even the young men. But Marietta,
shielded by her modesty and innocence, like the
petals of the rosebud in its dark-green calix, did not
suspect the mischief of which she was the occasion,
and continued courteous to everybody. This touched
the young men, who said, “Why condemn the pure and
harmless child—she is not guilty!” Then the fathers
said the same thing; then the mothers took it up,
and finally all—even the pious maidens. For, let who
would talk with Marietta, she was sure to gain their
esteem. So before half a year had passed, everybody
had spoken to her, and everybody loved her. But she
did not suspect that she was the object of such general
regard, as she had not before suspected that she was
the object of dislike. Does the violet, hidden in the
downtrodden grass, think how sweet it is?</p>

<p>Now every one wished to make amends for the injustice
they had done Marietta. Sympathy deepened
the tenderness of their attachment. Marietta found
herself greeted everywhere in a more friendly way than
ever; she was more cordially welcomed; more heartily
invited to the rural sports and dances.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>All men, however, are not endowed with tender
sympathy; some have hearts hardened like Pharaoh’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</span>
This arises, no doubt, from that natural depravity
which has come upon men in consequence of the fall
of Adam, or because, at their baptism, the devil is not
brought sufficiently under subjection.</p>

<p>A remarkable example of this hardness of heart was
given by one Colin, the richest farmer and proprietor
in Napoule, whose vineyards and olive gardens, whose
lemon and orange trees could hardly be counted in
a day. One thing particularly demonstrates the perverseness
of his disposition; he was twenty-seven years
old, and had never yet asked for what purpose girls
had been created!</p>

<p>True, all the people, especially damsels of a certain
age, willingly forgave him this sin, and looked upon
him as one of the best young men under the sun. His
fine figure, his fresh, unembarrassed manner, his look,
his laugh, enabled him to gain the favorable opinion
of the aforesaid people, who would have forgiven him,
had there been occasion, any one of the deadly sins.
But the decision of such judges is not always to be
trusted.</p>

<p>While both old and young at Napoule had become
reconciled to the innocent Marietta, and proffered their
sympathies to her, Colin was the only one who had no
pity upon the poor child. If Marietta was talked of
he became as dumb as a fish. If he met her in the
street he would turn red and white with anger, and cast
sidelong glances at her of the most malicious kind.</p>

<p>If at evening the young people met upon the seashore
near the old castle ruins for sprightly pastimes,
or rural dances, or to sing catches, Colin was the merriest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</span>
among them. But as soon as Marietta arrived the
rascally fellow was silent, and all the gold in the world
couldn’t make him sing. What a pity, when he had
such a fine voice! Everybody listened to it so willingly,
and its store of songs was endless.</p>

<p>All the maidens looked kindly upon Colin, and he
was friendly with all of them. He had, as we have
said, a roguish glance, which the lasses feared and
loved; and it was so sweet they would like to have had
it painted. But, as might naturally be expected, the
offended Marietta did not look graciously upon him.
And in that she was perfectly right. Whether he
smiled or not, it was all the same to her. As to his
roguish glance, why she would never hear it mentioned;
and therein too she was perfectly right. When
he told a tale (and he knew thousands) and everybody
listened, she nudged her neighbor, or perhaps threw
tufts of grass at Peter or Paul, and laughed and
chattered, and did not listen to Colin at all. This
behavior quite provoked the proud fellow, so that he
would break off in the middle of his story and stalk
sullenly away.</p>

<p>Revenge is sweet. The daughter of Mother Manon
well knew how to triumph. Yet Marietta was a right
good child and quite too tender-hearted. If Colin was
silent, it gave her pain. If he was downcast, she
laughed no more. If he went away, she did not stay
long behind: but hurried to her home, and wept tears
of repentance, more beautiful than those of the Magdalen,
although she had not sinned like the Magdalen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Father Jerome, the pastor of Napoule, was an old
man of seventy, who possessed all the virtues of a saint,
and only one failing; which was, that by reason of his
advanced years, he was hard of hearing. But, on that
very account, his homilies were more acceptable to
the children of his baptism and blessing. True, he
preached only of two subjects, as if they comprehended
the whole of religion. It was either “Little children,
love one another,” or it was “Mysterious are the ways
of Providence.” And truly there is so much Faith,
Love, and Hope in these that one might at a pinch be
saved by them. The little children loved one another
most obediently, and trusted in the ways of Providence.
Only Colin, with his flinty heart, would know nothing
of either: for even when he professed to be friendly,
he entertained the deepest malice.</p>

<p>The Napoulese went to the annual market or fair
of the city of Vence. It was truly a joyful time, and
though they had but little gold to buy with, there were
many goods to look at. Now Marietta and Mother
Manon went to the fair with the rest, and Colin was
also there. He bought a great many curiosities and
trifles for his friends—but he would not spend a farthing
for Marietta. And yet he was always at her
elbow, though he did not speak to her, nor she to him.
It was easy to see that he was brooding over some
scheme of wickedness.</p>

<p>Mother Manon stood gazing before a shop, when she
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh! Marietta, see that beautiful cup! A queen
would not be ashamed to raise it to her lips. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</span>
see: the edge is of dazzling gold, and the flowers
upon it could not bloom more beautifully in the
garden, although they are only painted. And in
the midst of this Paradise! pray see, Marietta, how
the apples are smiling on the trees. They are verily
tempting. And Adam can not withstand it, as the enchanting
Eve offers him one for food! And do see
how prettily the little frisking lamb skips around the
old tiger, and the snow-white dove with her golden
throat stands there before the vulture, as if she would
caress him!”</p>

<p>Marietta could not satisfy herself with looking.
“Had I such a cup, mother!” said she, “it is far too
beautiful to drink out of: I would place my flowers
in it and constantly peep into Paradise. We are at
the fair in Vence, but when I look on the picture I
feel as if I were in Paradise.”</p>

<p>So spoke Marietta, and called her companions to the
spot, to share her admiration of the cup: but the young
men soon joined the maidens, until at length almost
half the inhabitants of Napoule were assembled before
the wonderfully beautiful cup. But miraculously beautiful
was it mainly from its inestimable, translucent
porcelain, with gilded handles and glowing colors.
They asked the merchant timidly: “Sir, what is the
price of it?” And he answered: “Among friends, it
is worth a hundred livres.” Then they all became
silent, and went away in despair. When the Napoulese
were all gone from the front of the shop, Colin came
there by stealth, threw the merchant a hundred livres
upon the counter, had the cup put in a box well packed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</span>
with cotton, and then carried it off. What evil plans
he had in view no one would have surmised.</p>

<p>Near Napoule, on his way home, it being already
dusk, he met old Jacques, the Justice’s servant, returning
from the fields. Jacques was a very good man,
but excessively stupid.</p>

<p>“I will give thee money enough to get something
to drink, Jacques,” said Colin, “if thou wilt bear this
box to Manon’s house, and leave it there; and if any
one should see thee, and inquire from whom the box
came, say ‘A stranger gave it to me.’ But never disclose
my name, or I will always detest thee.”</p>

<p>Jacques promised this, took the drink-money and
the box, and went with it toward the little dwelling
between the olive trees and the African acacias.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Before he arrived there he encountered his master,
Justice Hautmartin, who asked: “Jacques, what art
thou carrying?”</p>

<p>“A box for Mother Manon. But, sir, I can not say
from whom it comes.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because Colin would always detest me.”</p>

<p>“It is well that thou canst keep a secret. But it is
already late; give me the box, for I am going to-morrow
to see Mother Manon; I will deliver it to her
and not betray that it came from Colin. It will save
thee a walk, and furnish me a good excuse for calling
on the old lady.”</p>

<p>Jacques gave the box to his master, whom he was
accustomed to obey implicitly in all things. The justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</span>
bore it into his chamber, and examined it by the
light with some curiosity. On the lid was neatly
written with red chalk: “For the lovely and dear
Marietta.” But Monsieur Hautmartin well knew that
this was some of Colin’s mischief, and that some
knavish trick lurked under the whole. He therefore
opened the box carefully for fear that a mouse or rat
should be concealed within. When he beheld the wondrous
cup, which he had seen at Vence, he was dreadfully
shocked, for Monsieur Hautmartin was a skilful
casuist, and knew that the inventions and devices of
the human heart are evil from our youth upward. He
saw at once that Colin designed this cup as a means
of bringing misfortune upon Marietta: perhaps to give
out, when it should be in her possession, that it was
the present of some successful lover in the town, or the
like, so that all decent people would thereafter keep
aloof from Marietta. Therefore Monsieur Hautmartin
resolved, in order to prevent any evil reports, to
profess himself the giver. Moreover, he loved Marietta,
and would gladly have seen her observe more
strictly toward himself the sayings of the gray-headed
priest Jerome, “Little children, love one another.” In
truth, Monsieur Hautmartin was a little child of fifty
years old, and Marietta did not think the saying applied
particularly to him. Mother Manon, on the contrary,
thought that the justice was a clever little child,
he had gold and a high reputation from one end of
Napoule to the other. And when the justice spoke of
marriage, and Marietta ran away in affright, Mother
Manon remained sitting, and had no fear for the tall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</span>
staid gentleman. It must also be confessed there were
no faults in his person. And although Colin might be
the handsomest man in the village, yet the justice far
surpassed him in two things, namely, in the number
of years, and in a very, very big nose. Yes, this nose,
which always went before the justice like a herald
to proclaim his approach, was a real elephant among
human noses.</p>

<p>With this proboscis, his good purpose, and the cup,
the justice went the following morning to the house
between the olive trees and the African acacias.</p>

<p>“For the beautiful Marietta,” said he, “I hold nothing
too costly. Yesterday you admired the cup at
Vence; to-day allow me, lovely Marietta, to lay it and
my devoted heart at your feet.”</p>

<p>Manon and Marietta were transported beyond measure
when they beheld the cup. Manon’s eyes glistened
with delight, but Marietta turned and said: “I can
neither take your heart nor your cup.”</p>

<p>Then Mother Manon was angry, and cried out:
“But I accept both heart and cup. Oh, thou little
fool, how long wilt thou despise thy good fortune!
For whom dost thou tarry? Will a count of Provence
make thee his bride, that thou scornest the Justice of
Napoule? I know better how to look after my interests.
Monsieur Hautmartin, I deem it an honor to call
thee my son-in-law.”</p>

<p>Then Marietta went out and wept bitterly, and hated
the beautiful cup with all her heart.</p>

<p>But the justice, drawing the palm of his flabby hand
over his nose, spoke thus judiciously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</span></p>

<p>“Mother Manon, hurry nothing. The dove will at
length, when it learns to know me better, give way. I
am not impetuous. I have some skill among women,
and before a quarter of a year passes by I will insinuate
myself into Marietta’s good graces.”</p>

<p>“Thy nose is too large for that,” whispered Marietta,
who listened outside the door and laughed to
herself. In fact, the quarter of a year passed by and
Monsieur Hautmartin had not yet pierced the heart
even with the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>During this quarter of a year Marietta had other
affairs to attend to. The cup gave her much vexation
and trouble, and something else besides.</p>

<p>For a fortnight nothing else was talked of in
Napoule, and every one said it is a present from
the justice, and the marriage is already agreed upon.
Marietta solemnly declared to all her companions that
she would rather plunge to the bottom of the sea than
marry the justice, but the maidens continued to banter
her all the more, saying: “Oh, how blissful it must
be to repose in the shadow of his nose!” This was
her first vexation.</p>

<p>Then Mother Manon had the cruelty to force Marietta
to rinse out the cup every morning at the spring
under the rock and to fill it with fresh flowers. She
hoped by this to accustom Marietta to the cup and
heart of the giver. But Marietta continued to hate
both the gift and giver, and her work at the spring
became an actual punishment. Second vexation.</p>

<p>Then, when in the morning, she came to the spring,
twice every week she found on the rock, immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</span>
over it, some most beautiful flowers, handsomely arranged,
all ready for the decoration of the cup. And
on the flower-stalks a strip of paper was always tied,
on which was written, “Dear Marietta.” Now no one
need expect to impose upon little Marietta as if magicians
and fairies were still in the world. Consequently
she knew that both the flowers and papers must have
come from Monsieur Hautmartin. Marietta, indeed,
would not smell them because the living breath from
out of the justice’s nose had perfumed them. Nevertheless
she took the flowers, because they were finer
than wild flowers, and tore the slip of paper into a
thousand pieces, which she strewed upon the spot
where the flowers usually lay. But this did not vex
Justice Hautmartin, whose love was unparalleled in its
kind as his nose was in its kind. Third vexation.</p>

<p>At length it came out in conversation with Monsieur
Hautmartin that he was not the giver of the beautiful
flowers. Then who could it be? Marietta was utterly
astounded at the unexpected discovery. Thenceforth
she took the flowers from the rock more kindly; but,
further, Marietta was—what maidens are not wont to
be—very inquisitive. She conjectured first this and
then that young man in Napoule. Yet her conjectures
were in vain. She looked and listened far into the
night; she rose earlier than usual. But she looked and
listened in vain. And still twice a week in the morning
the miraculous flowers lay upon the rock, and upon
the strip of paper wound round them she always read
the silent sigh, “Dear Marietta!” Such an incident
would have made even the most indifferent inquisitive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</span>
But curiosity at length became a burning pain. Fourth
vexation.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Now Father Jerome, on Sunday, had again preached
from the text: “Mysterious are the dispensations of
Providence.” And little Marietta thought, if Providence
would only dispense that I might at length find
out who is the flower dispenser. Father Jerome was
never wrong.</p>

<p>On a summer night, when it was far too warm to
rest, Marietta awoke very early, and could not resume
her sleep. Therefore she sprang joyously from her
couch as the first streaks of dawn flashed against the
window of her little chamber, over the waves of the
sea and the Lerinian Isles, dressed herself, and went
out to wash her forehead, breast, and arms in the cool
spring. She took her hat with her, intending to take
a walk by the seashore, as she knew of a retired place
for bathing.</p>

<p>In order to reach this retired spot, it was necessary
to pass over the rocks behind the house, and thence
down through the orange and palm trees. On this
occasion Marietta could not pass through them; for,
under the youngest and most slender of the palms lay
a tall young man in profound sleep—near him a nosegay
of most splendid flowers. A white paper lay
thereon, from which probably a sigh was again breathing.
How could Marietta get by there?</p>

<p>She stood still, trembling with fright. She would
go home again. Hardly had she retreated a couple of
steps, ere she looked again at the sleeper, and remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</span>
motionless. Yet the distance prevented her
from recognizing his face. Now the mystery was to
be solved, or never. She tripped lightly nearer to the
palms; but he seemed to stir—then she ran again
toward the cottage. His movements were but the fearful
imaginings of Marietta. Now she returned again
on her way toward the palms; but his sleep might perhaps
be only dissembled—swiftly she ran toward the
cottage—but who would flee for a mere probability?
She trod more boldly the path toward the palms.</p>

<p>With these fluctuations of her timid and joyous
spirit, between fright and curiosity, with these to-and-fro
trippings between the house and the palm-trees,
she at length nearly approached the sleeper; at
the same time curiosity became more powerful than
fear.</p>

<p>“What is he to me? My way leads me directly
past him. Whether he sleeps or wakes, I will go
straight on.” So thought Manon’s daughter. But
she passed not by, but stood looking directly in the
face of the flower-giver, in order to be certain who
it was. Besides, he slept as if it were the first time
in a month. And who was it? Now, who else
should it be but the arch, wicked Colin.</p>

<p>So it was <em>he</em> who had annoyed the gentle maiden,
and given her so much trouble with Monsieur Hautmartin,
because he bore a grudge against her; he had
been the one who had teased her with flowers, in order
to torture her curiosity. Wherefore? He hated Marietta.
He behaved himself always most shamefully
toward the poor child. He avoided her when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</span>
could; and when he could not, he grieved the good-natured
little one. With all the other maidens of
Napoule he was more chatty, friendly, courteous, than
toward Marietta. Consider—he had never once asked
her to dance, and yet she danced bewitchingly.</p>

<p>Now there he lay, surprised, taken in the act. Revenge
swelled in Marietta’s bosom. What disgrace
could she subject him to? She took the nosegay, unloosened
it, strewed his present over the sleeper in
scorn. But the paper, on which appeared again the
sigh, “Dear Marietta!” she retained, and thrust quickly
into her bosom. She wished to preserve this proof of
his handwriting. Marietta was sly. Now she would
go away. But her revenge was not yet satisfied. She
could not leave the place without returning Colin’s ill-will.
She took the violet-colored silken ribbon from
her hat, and threw it lightly around the sleeper’s arm
and around the tree, and with three knots tied Colin
fast. Now when he awoke, how astonished he would
be! How his curiosity would torment him to ascertain
who had played him this trick! He could not possibly
know. So much the better; it served him right.
She seemed to regret her work when she had finished
it. Her bosom throbbed impetuously. Indeed, I believe
that a little tear filled her eye, as she compassionately
gazed upon the guilty one. Slowly she retreated
to the orange grove by the rocks—she looked
around often—slowly ascended the rocks, looking
down among the palm trees as she ascended. Then
she hastened to Mother Manon, who was calling her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That very day Colin practised new mischief. What
did he? He wished to shame the poor Marietta publicly.
Ah! she never thought that every one in Napoule
knew her violet-colored ribbon! Colin remembered
it but too well. Proudly he bound it around his
hat, and exhibited it to the gaze of all the world as
a conquest. And male and female cried out: “He has
received it from Marietta.”—And all the maidens said
angrily: “The reprobate!” And all the young men
who liked to see Marietta cried out: “The reprobate!”</p>

<p>“How! Mother Manon?” shrieked the Justice Hautmartin
when he came to her house, and he shrieked
so loudly that it reechoed wonderfully through his
nose. “How! do you suffer this? my betrothed presents
the young proprietor Colin with her hat-band!
It is high time that we celebrate our nuptials. When
that is over, then I shall have a right to speak.”</p>

<p>“You have a right!” answered Mother Manon, “if
things are so, the marriage must take place forthwith.
When that is done, all will go right.”</p>

<p>“But, Mother Manon, Marietta always refuses to
give me her consent.”</p>

<p>“Prepare the marriage feast.”</p>

<p>“But she will not even look kindly at me; and when
I seat myself at her side, the little savage jumps up
and runs away.”</p>

<p>“Justice, only prepare the marriage feast.”</p>

<p>“But if Marietta resists—”</p>

<p>“We will take her by surprise. We will go to
Father Jerome on Monday morning early, and he
shall quietly celebrate the marriage. This we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</span>
easily accomplished with him. I am her mother, you
the first judicial person in Napoule. He must obey.
Marietta need know nothing about it. Early on Monday
morning I will send her to Father Jerome all
alone, with a message so that she will suspect nothing.
Then the priest shall speak earnestly to her. Half an
hour afterward we two will come. Then swiftly to
the altar. And even if Marietta should then say No,
what does it matter? The old priest can hear
nothing. But till then, mum to Marietta and all
Napoule.”</p>

<p>So the secret remained with the two. Marietta
dreamed not of the good luck which was in store for
her. She thought only of Colin’s wickedness, which
had made her the common talk of the whole place.
Oh! how she repented her heedlessness about the ribbon;
and yet in her heart she forgave the reprobate
his crime. Marietta was far too good. She told her
mother, she told all her playmates: “Colin has found
my lost band. I never gave it to him. He only
wishes to vex me with it. You all know that Colin
was always ill-disposed toward me, and always sought
to mortify me!”</p>

<p>Ah! the poor child! she knew not what new abomination
the malicious fellow was again contriving.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Early in the morning Marietta went to the spring
with the cup. There were no flowers yet on the rock.
It was still much too early; for the sun had scarcely
risen from the sea.</p>

<p>Footsteps were heard. Colin came in sight, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</span>
flowers in his hand. Marietta became very red. Colin
stammered out: “Good morning, Marietta,” but the
greeting came not from his heart.</p>

<p>“Why dost thou wear my ribbon so publicly,
Colin?” said Marietta, and placed the cup upon the
rock. “I did not give it thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst not give it to me, dear Marietta?”
asked he, and inward rage made him deadly pale.</p>

<p>Marietta was ashamed of the falsehood, drooped
her eyelids, and said after a while: “Well, I did give
it thee, yet thou shouldst not have worn it. Give it
back.”</p>

<p>Slowly he untied it; his anger was so great that he
could not prevent the tears from filling his eyes, nor
the sighs from escaping his breast.—“Dear Marietta,
leave thy ribbon with me,” said he softly.</p>

<p>“No,” answered she.</p>

<p>Then his suppressed passion changed into desperation.
Sighing, he looked toward heaven, then sadly
on Marietta, who, silent and abashed, stood by the
spring with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>He wound the violet-colored ribbon around the
stalks of the flowers, and said: “There, take them all,”
and threw the flowers so spitefully against the magnificent
cup upon the rock that it was thrown down
and dashed to pieces. Maliciously he fled away.</p>

<p>Mother Manon, lurking behind the window, had
seen and heard all. When the cup broke, hearing and
sight left her. She was scarcely able to speak for
very horror. And as she pushed with all her strength
against the narrow window, to shout after the guilty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</span>
one, it gave way, and with one crash fell to earth and
was shattered in pieces.</p>

<p>So much ill-luck would have discomposed any other
woman. But Manon soon recovered herself. “How
lucky that I was a witness to this roguery!” exclaimed
she; “he must to the justice—he shall replace both cup
and window-sash with his gold. It will give a rich
dowry to Marietta.” But when Marietta brought in
the fragments of the shattered cup, when Manon saw
the Paradise lost, the good man Adam without a head,
and of Eve not a solitary limb remaining, the serpent
unhurt, triumphing, the tiger safe, but the little lamb
gone even to the very tail, as if the tiger had swallowed
it, then Mother Manon screamed forth curses
against Colin, and said: “One can easily see that this
<i>fall</i> came from the hand of the devil.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She took the cup in one hand, Marietta in the other,
and went, about nine o’clock, to where Monsieur Hautmartin
was wont to sit in judgment. She there made
a great outcry, and showed the broken cup and the
Paradise lost. Marietta wept bitterly.</p>

<p>The justice, when he saw the broken cup and his
beautiful bride in tears, flew into so violent a rage
toward Colin that his nose was as violet-colored as
Marietta’s well-known hat-band. He immediately despatched
his bailiffs to bring the criminal before him.</p>

<p>Colin came, overwhelmed with grief. Mother
Manon now repeated her complaint with great eloquence
before justice, bailiffs, and scribes.—But Colin
listened not. He stepped to Marietta and whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</span>
to her: “Forgive me, dear Marietta, as I forgive thee.
I broke thy cup unintentionally; but thou, thou hast
broken my heart!”</p>

<p>“What whispering is that?” cried Justice Hautmartin,
with magisterial authority. “Harken to this
accusation, and defend yourself.”</p>

<p>“I have naught to defend. I broke the cup against
my will,” said Colin.</p>

<p>“That I verily believe,” said Marietta, sobbing. “I
am as guilty as he; for I offended him—then he threw
the ribbon and flowers to me. He could not help it.”</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Mother Manon. “Do you intend to
defend him? Mr. Justice, pronounce his sentence. He
has broken the cup, and he does not deny it.”</p>

<p>“Since you can not deny it, Mr. Colin,” said the
Justice, “you must pay three hundred livres for the
cup, for it is worth that; and then for—”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted Colin, “it is not worth that. I
bought it at Vence for Marietta for a hundred livres.”</p>

<p>“You bought it, sir brazen face?” shrieked the Justice,
and his whole face became like Marietta’s hat-band.
He could not and would not say more, for he
dreaded a disagreeable investigation of the matter.</p>

<p>But Colin was vexed at the imputation, and said: “I
sent this cup on the evening of the fair, by your own
servant, to Marietta. There stands Jaques in the door.
Speak, Jaques, did I not give thee the box to carry to
Mother Manon?”</p>

<p>Monsieur Hautmartin wished to interrupt this conversation
by speaking loudly. But the simple Jaques
said: “Only recollect, Justice, you took away Colin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</span>
box from me, and carried what was in it to Mother
Manon. The box lies there under the papers.”</p>

<p>Then the bailiffs were ordered to remove the simpleton;
and Colin was also directed to retire, until he
should be sent for again.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Justice,” interposed Colin, “but
this business shall be your last in Napoule. I know
this, that you would ingratiate yourself with Mother
Manon and Marietta by means of my property. When
you want me, you will have to ride to Grasse to the
Governor’s.” With that, Colin departed.</p>

<p>Monsieur Hautmartin was quite puzzled with this
affair, and in his confusion knew not what he was
about. Manon shook her head. The affair was dark
and mysterious to her. “Who will now pay me for
the broken cup?” she asked.</p>

<p>“To me,” said Marietta, with glowing, brightened
countenance, “to <em>me</em> it is already paid for.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Colin rode that same day to the Governor at Grasse,
and came back early the next morning. But Justice
Hautmartin only laughed at him, and removed all of
Mother Manon’s suspicions by swearing he would let
his nose be cut off if Colin did not pay three hundred
livres for the broken cup. He also went with Mother
Manon to talk with Father Jerome about the marriage,
and impressed upon him the necessity of earnestly
setting before Marietta her duty as an obedient daughter
in not opposing the will of her mother. This the
pious old man promised, although he understood not
the half of what they shouted in his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</span></p>

<p>When Monday morning came Mother Manon said
to her daughter: “Dress yourself handsomely, and
carry this myrtle wreath to Father Jerome; he wants
it for a bride.” Marietta dressed herself in her Sunday
clothes, took the myrtle wreath unsuspiciously, and
carried it to Father Jerome.</p>

<p>On the way Colin met her, and greeted her joyfully,
though timidly; and when she told him where
she was taking the wreath, Colin said: “I am going
the same way, for I am carrying the money for the
church’s tenths to the priest.” And as they went on
he took her hand silently, and both trembled as if they
designed some crime against each other.</p>

<p>“Hast thou forgiven me?” whispered Colin, anxiously.
“Ah! Marietta, what have I done to thee, that
thou art so cruel toward me?”</p>

<p>She could only say: “Be quiet, Colin, you shall have
the ribbon again; and I will preserve the cup since it
came from you! Did it really come from you?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Marietta, canst thou doubt it? All I have I
would gladly give thee. Wilt thou, hereafter, be as
kind to me as thou art to others?”</p>

<p>She replied not. But as she entered the parsonage
she looked aside at him, and when she saw his fine
eyes filled with tears, she whispered softly: “Dear
Colin!” Then he bent down and kissed her hand.
With this the door of a chamber opened and Father
Jerome, with venerable aspect, stood before them.
The young couple held fast to each other. I know not
whether this was the effect of the hand-kissing, or the
awe they felt for the sage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</span></p>

<p>Marietta handed him the myrtle wreath. He laid
it upon her head and said: “Little children, love one
another;” and then urged the good maiden, in the
most touching and pathetic manner, to love Colin. For
the old gentleman, from his hardness of hearing, had
either mistaken the name of the bridegroom, or forgotten
it, and thought Colin must be the bridegroom.</p>

<p>Then Marietta’s heart softened under the exhortation,
and with tears and sobs she exclaimed: “Ah!
I have loved him for a long time, but he hates me.”</p>

<p>“I hate thee, Marietta?” cried Colin. “My soul has
lived only in thee since thou camest to Napoule. Oh!
Marietta, how could I hope and believe that thou didst
love me? Does not all Napoule worship thee?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, dost thou avoid me, Colin, and prefer
all my companions before me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Marietta, I feared and trembled with love and
anxiety when I beheld thee; I had not the courage to
approach thee; and when I was away from thee I was
most miserable.”</p>

<p>As they talked thus with each other the good father
thought they were quarreling; and he threw his arms
around them, brought them together, and said imploringly:
“Little children, love one another.”</p>

<p>Then Marietta sank on Colin’s breast, and Colin
threw his arms around her, and both faces beamed
with rapture. They forgot the priest, the whole
world. Each was sunk into the other. Both had so
completely lost their recollection that, unwittingly, they
followed the delightful Father Jerome into the church
and before the altar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</span></p>

<p>“Marietta!” sighed he.</p>

<p>“Colin!” sighed she.</p>

<p>In the church there were many devout worshipers;
but they witnessed Colin’s and Marietta’s marriage
with amazement. Many ran out before the close of
the ceremony, to spread the news throughout Napoule:
“Colin and Marietta are married.”</p>

<p>When the solemnization was over, Father Jerome
rejoiced that he had succeeded so well, and that such
little opposition had been made by the parties. He led
them into the parsonage.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Then Mother Manon arrived, breathless; she had
waited at home a long time for the bridegroom. He
had not arrived. At the last stroke of the clock she
grew anxious and went to Monsieur Hautmartin’s.
There a new surprise awaited her. She learned
that the Governor, together with the officers of the
Viguerie, had appeared and taken possession of
the accounts, chests, and papers of the justice and
at the same time arrested Monsieur Hautmartin.</p>

<p>“This, surely, is the work of that wicked Colin,”
thought she, and hurried to the parsonage in order
to apologize to Father Jerome for delaying the marriage.
The good gray-headed old man advanced
toward her, proud of his work, and leading by the
hand the newly married pair.</p>

<p>Now Mother Manon lost her wits and her speech in
good earnest when she learned what had happened.
But Colin had more thoughts and power of speech
than in his whole previous life. He told of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</span>
love and the broken cup, the falsehood of the justice,
and how he had unmasked this unjust magistrate
in the Viguerie at Grasse. Then he besought Mother
Manon’s blessing, since all this had happened without
any fault on the part of Marietta or himself.</p>

<p>Father Jerome, who for a long while could not make
out what had happened, when he received a full explanation
of the marriage through mistake, piously
folded his hands and exclaimed, with uplifted eyes:
“Wonderful are the dispensations of Providence!”
Colin and Marietta kissed his hands; Mother Manon,
through sheer veneration of heaven, gave the young
couple her blessing, but remarked incidentally that her
head seemed turned round.</p>

<p>Mother Manon herself was pleased with her son-in-law
when she came to know the full extent of his
property, and especially when she found that Monsieur
Hautmartin and his nose had been arrested.</p>

<p>“But am I then really a wife?” asked Marietta;
“and really Colin’s wife?”</p>

<p>Mother Manon nodded her head, and Marietta hung
upon Colin’s arm. Thus they went to Colin’s farm,
to his dwelling-house, through the garden.</p>

<p>“Look at the flowers, Marietta,” said Colin; “how
carefully I cultivated them for your cup!”</p>

<p>Colin, who had not expected so pleasant an event,
now prepared a wedding feast on the spur of the occasion.
Two days was it continued. All Napoule was
feasted. Who shall describe Colin’s extravagance?</p>

<p>The broken cup is preserved in the family to the
present day as a memorial and sacred relic.</p>

<p><em>Popular wherever German is read, Riehl
ought to be more than a mere name among
readers of English. In “Castle Neideck” there
is the old-world atmosphere, the truth to nature,
the originality, the seriousness of aim,
lightened with a sly humor, that characterize
all the writings of this most important author—including
his histories of culture and morals.
Of his culture novels in general the author himself
says: “The problem of the historical novel
is to display upon the background of social
conditions freely modeled characters”—and of
“Castle Neideck” in particular: “It is entirely
imaginative, based on a study of the times.”</em></p>

<p><em>Riehl was born in 1823 at Biebrich, near
Wiesbaden. His father was Castle Administrator
of the place, and undoubtedly prototype
of the old schoolmaster in Castle
Neideck, as, by his son’s own account, Burg
Reichenberg, near St. Goarshausen, was prototype
of Castle Neideck itself. In 1880 Riehl
was ennobled, and died in 1897.</em></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In Germany there are several castles of the name of
Neideck, but, doubtless, the most beautiful is that
of the principality of Westerau, whose proud
ruins looked down from the steep slate rock over the
broad plain of the Felber Valley, and far beyond to
the heights of the Dill Mountains.</p>

<p>On the slope of the mountains nestles the little village
of Westerau: the site of the new castle. At the
time of the Seven Years’ War a part of this was habitable,
but even then most of it was roofless and a
ruin. At the back the castle was open, but the front
was protected by a moat and a drawbridge.</p>

<p>Fixed upon the rock like the nest of some gigantic
bird, Neideck was considered a strong, though not
impregnable, fortress. It was garrisoned by three
men: a sergeant and two common soldiers; all three
were disabled. The sole defense of the fortress, one
old cannon, thundered above the valley on the prince’s
birthday and whenever a princess gave birth to a child.
It is hard to tell why there was a garrison at all;
probably for no other reason than because it had
not been withdrawn; the three men had been left by
a previous garrison as the ruins had been left by a
previous castle. The veterans served at Neideck because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</span>
they could not serve elsewhere. Was not that
reason enough? The three men had a roof to cover
them, good air, and few expenses.</p>

<p>Besides the garrison, one other, the schoolmaster,
lived in the castle. He was Philip Balzer, called
“Burg” Balzer (Fortress Balzer) to distinguish him
from all other Balzers of that locality. Burg Balzer’s
quarters were in the keeper’s lodge, near the gate, and
in his quarters he kept school. The parish consisted
of twelve thatched cottages, standing at the foot of the
hill of Neideck. It was too poor to provide a regular
schoolhouse, so the prince graciously permitted the
schoolmaster to use the lodge for that purpose, which
answered very well. In all there were about ten scholars,
and these were huddled together like sheep in a
thunderstorm.</p>

<p>Philip’s father had been herdsman as well as schoolmaster:
the office had descended from father to son;
but now there were so few cattle that a child could
watch them, and Philip detailed his laziest pupil for
that duty. From a pedagogic standpoint the practise
was of questionable value, for, as in summer, children
prefer the open air, why, every child made efforts to
be the laziest.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster and the garrison would have been
happy but for the fact that their chief necessities, food
and drink, were insufficient. Their quarters were dry,
the air was bracing, and their clothes appeared to be
imperishable.</p>

<p>This calm was broken by bad news. With November
of 1757 the tide of war came in upon them. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</span>
the watch-towers they heard the distant roar of cannon,
while the fugitive peasants could see the Prussian
soldiers foraging not far away. What could Neideck
do? The men of the garrison held a council; the sergeant
suggested blowing up the castle; one of the soldiers
counseled honorable surrender; the other advised
immediate flight. The schoolmaster, who had been
invited to the council, urged resistance to the death;
resistance to the point of annihilation.</p>

<p>During the evening of November 13 a chasseur galloped
up the mountainside with orders to “Retire to the
other side of the Schwarzach, and there join the imperial
army! Take all arms and commissary stores;
destroy everything that can not be transported!”</p>

<p>The orders pleased the garrison; there was little to
take away and nothing to destroy. But the cannon!
What could they do with that? It had no wheels;
they could not draw it after them; and, as there were
no oxen in the village, they could not haul it.</p>

<p>“Let us spike it!” said the sergeant; “that is done
in wartime.” But how? He did not know. To blow
it up might be dangerous. Finally they followed the
advice of the schoolmaster. The well was two hundred
feet deep, and within the memory of man it had
never held water. They dropped the cannon into
the well.</p>

<p>When they were setting out, the sergeant asked the
schoolmaster where they should find the Schwarzach.
The schoolmaster gave the desired information; critical
pedagogy is supposed to follow the principle that it
is better to give any answer than to confess ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</span></p>

<p>The schoolmaster refused to abandon the fortress:
he watched the soldiers sorrowfully as they marched
down the hill and disappeared like phantoms in the silence
and the darkness. “They will not return,” he
mused; “I am now the sole keeper of the fort!” He
drew the bridge, barred the gates, and went into his
lodge.</p>

<p>For a long time he had been laying in provisions:
apples, nuts, prunes, bread, bacon, and smoked beef.
These, with an old dressing gown and “Gottsched’s
Critical Art of Poetry,” he carried to the western slope
of the hill. He waited an instant, listening, turning
his head in all directions, to make sure that he was
alone, for the night was dark and he could see nothing;
then he climbed over a broken wall, parted the
thick branches of a thorn-bush, and crawled through
an opening into an underground passage choked with
rubbish.</p>

<p>This passage was known only to Burg Balzer. He
had found it in his youth. In a place where the passage
widened he had made a bed of leaves, and, lying
there on rainy days, many an hour, for many years,
he had dreamed his dreams. He loved to dream of
the days of knighthood; and the dim light of his
hiding-place gave atmosphere to his illusions. At times
he had worked hard to clear away the rubbish and
penetrate deeper under ground. Philip thought he
might find wine here. Strange things had been found
before this in secret passages! In the abandoned cellar
of a castle in Alsatia ancient wine had been found;
the casks had rotted and dropped apart, but the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</span>
wine had formed a skin. As he went alone, Philip
decided to hide in his grotto and wait for the first
shock of war to pass; he should be safer down there
than with the fugitive peasants in the woods. It was
romance as well as common sense that led him to hide
there. Philip Balzer was a German schoolmaster. “I
am Burg Balzer,” he said to himself; “this is my
castle! I must be faithful; I must stand or fall with
this stronghold. I am the real warder, and to guard
Neideck is my heritage. Let the Prussians blow it
up and me with it! Better, far better, to wing my
flight thus than to forsake my trust!”</p>

<p>To tell the exact truth, Burg Balzer was not at all
afraid that he should be blown up; from an old legend
he had learned that destiny had marked him for important
work; he was to restore prosperity to Neideck.
Neideck, the ancestral home of the princes of Westerau,
had been occupied by the family until the Thirty
Years’ War broke out. But on the approach of the
imperial army the princes had escaped, leaving a strong
garrison, and the peasants of the whole country had
taken refuge there. From that time onward Neideck
had been known as a stronghold. “And, in truth,” said
the schoolmaster, “it has always been a fortress; it has
never been a robbers’ nest.”</p>

<p>There was one stain on the record, however. In
the dark year, 1634, when the castle was packed with
fugitives, and provisions ran low, the commandant of
the fortress ordered his men to drive out the women
and the children, in order to “shut out useless mouths.”
The victims fell upon their knees and begged for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</span>
mercy; they cried out that they had no other refuge.
The commandant was deaf to their prayers. When
the gates closed behind them, the women cursed Neideck.
Three of the curses were remembered.</p>

<p>First—Let Neideck be a ruin, and let every stone
of that ruin bear witness against Neideck’s lord!</p>

<p>Second—One hundred years shall pass before a lord
of Neideck wins a woman’s love!</p>

<p>Third—To the shame of man, when all men are
powerless, let Neideck be saved by a woman!</p>

<p>The first two curses were already fulfilled. Soon
after the lord of Neideck had abandoned the women
and children to their fate, the castle was stormed, the
east wing was destroyed, and the once powerful fortress
fell into ruins. After that the reigning family lived
in the new castle in Westerau; not one of them returned
to Neideck. For a time governors and warders
kept the castle; not one of them was blessed by a
woman’s love. Some of them lived and died unmarried;
two had lost their wives; while the only man
among them all who had a wife was so tormented by
her that he cut his throat. The third curse was yet
to come; namely, after all the men had failed to save
Neideck, the place was to be redeemed by a woman.</p>

<p>Now, the schoolmaster, though not a woman, believed
that he was destined in some way to fulfill the
curse and be the means of saving the castle, and in
such a way as to bring about perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Philip’s dreams were so ardent and so bold that he
dared not speak of them or even think about them.
It was hope that made him cling to the castle; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</span>
dispelled all fear. He lived on dreams as much as on
his prunes and bacon.</p>

<p>Lying on his bed of leaves the second day after the
garrison’s departure, he detected the smell of burning
stubble. “It is the village!” he thought calmly, and
continued his dream. He heard cannon, now near, now
far away, and he heard other sounds, too: the clash of
arms, the pounding of horses’ hoofs, then silence fell—.</p>

<p>He had been underground two days and two nights;
he was tired of prunes and bacon, and of lying down
and of sitting still. Early in the morning he crept
out. Just as he reached the thorn-bush he heard the
rustling of leaves, and, peering out, he saw a goat tossing
his head and nibbling the last leaves of the late
autumn. The village lay in the distance, calm and
peaceful in the morning light; nor far, nor near, was
there a sign of war.</p>

<p>Tempted by the mellow sunlight, the schoolmaster
left his hiding-place, and saw that the peasants were
returning with their chattels to the deserted homes.
He skirted the hill and entered the village from the
opposite side of the castle. In the village he learned
that the soldiers had not entered Neideck. The peasants
blushed for their fears; they had suffered cold and
hunger in the woods; so had their cattle. The camp-followers,
finding the place deserted, had fired the
fields. Now the damages must be repaired! The
peasants praised the schoolmaster for his prudence;
they said he had done well to remain in the castle.
Philip was modest; he disclaimed their praises; he
lauded the castle—“a stronghold even in its ruin!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</span>
There is not a man on earth who has not faith in
something! Burg Balzer had faith in his castle.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On February 15, 1763, twelve couriers galloped out
of the courtyard of Hubertsburgh, and, blowing their
trumpets, rode hard in every direction toward all the
respective courts, announcing that the peace treaty
had been signed. A squadron of mounted messengers
followed them, proclaiming peace throughout the Roman
Empire of the German nation. The Seven Years’
War was over, and the fortress of Neideck could now
rest for generations to come. No more would the
thunder of distant cannon echo through the tower; nor
need the schoolmaster fear for his castle. He was
thankful for peace; glad that they called it the peace
of Hubertsburgh, for that place, he thought, must be
a little like my own Neideck. And now Burg Balzer
reigned supreme in Neideck; the garrison did not return;
the veterans’ quarters went to ruin; the roof fell
in. Philip rejoiced; to his mind ruins were unclaimed
property. “And,” thought he, “unclaimed property
belongs to him who takes it!” It seemed to him that
the giant ruin was now his own. It may be that he
could not have borne the trials of his dry profession
had it not been for the mystic charm of his castle.
It was his castle that made life sweet to him. When
the day was fine he kept school in the courtyard.
The elder-bush was in blossom; the blue sky floated
above the crumbling walls; the jackdaws circled above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</span>
the towers; the sparrows twittered. He was happy;
the dreams of his childhood nested in his heart,
and the droning <em>a, b, c</em> of the mischievous boys
sounded to him like a spring song.</p>

<p>Now and then he permitted the children to sing a
hymn, and when the old walls sent back the echoes the
hymn was as full of meaning as a fugue, and the days
of old with their men of blood and iron rose before
him, while the discord in the shrill voices of the children
ascended to the skies like songs of praise. Of all
hymns Philip loved best Luther’s “<em>A mighty fortress
is our God!</em>” When the hymn was ended, when the
last thin cry of the children had died away upon the
air, Balzer would explain to them that the stronghold,
or fortress, was man’s best type of the power and
eternal protection of God; and that God’s fidelity to
man could not be represented better than by the image
of a stronghold. Once when an impertinent pupil reminded
him that their own stronghold, the fortress of
Neideck, was going to ruin, and that new ravages were
visible every spring, Philip answered:</p>

<p>“If our stronghold shows weakness here and there,
it does so that we may see by the contrasting strength
of its main walls and its foundations that it was built
for all eternity. That is why a stronghold is a true
image of the eternal being of God. It was in strongholds
that Luther worked; he wrote his hymn in the
fortress of Coburg and translated the Bible in the fortress
of Wartburg.”</p>

<p>When the day was fine he took his flute, and played
it as he went down the east side of the mountain, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</span>
by the children. Often the teacher and his
pupils wandered into the woods opposite the castle.
There Philip played his flute and the children sang and
the echoes answered, and there the schoolmaster told
the stories of all the strongholds in the country; not
one of them was as remarkable as that of Neideck!</p>

<p>On rainy days he kept school in the small dark
lodge; the lessons were then short, and when the children
had gone home, Balzer would go down into the
dungeon or up into the watch-towers. The towers
rose high above the mass of stone and overlooked the
country. A rotten bridge stretched from the top of
one tower to the top of the other. To reach the first
Philip had to go to an upper story of the adjoining
building; and to reach the second, where the tormented
husband had cut his throat, he was forced to cross
this bridge. Balancing his thin body on the decaying
timbers, far above the broken roof of the castle, buffeted
by the tempest and in peril of his life, Burg
Balzer would shout strange and meaningless words,
which he supposed were in the language of the ancient
Teutons: “<em>Heia, Weia, Weigala, Waia!</em>” In his mind
he was a warder of the far-off bygone days; the
enemy was on its way to Neideck, winding up through
the ravines of the Dill Mountains, and his cry was
raised to warn the men within his castle. It was as
difficult to get back to reality as it was to climb the
bridge!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Long before the war the schoolmaster had found
some old straw and fragments of a jug. Had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</span>
straw been the bed of the last prisoner of the dungeon?
and what of the jug? Balzer was tender-hearted, but
it would have pleased him to find proof that the man
of his imagination had starved to death on the straw,
drinking his last, unwholesome draft from the jug.</p>

<p>From brooding over his relics he went aloft, climbing
from one roofless room to another. In the “Hall
of the Knights” he rested from his efforts. Up there
the arches had given way, and bits of stone and clouds
of lime-dust were sifted by the decaying joists. In
the “Hall of the Knights” he could fancy that he was
exchanging opinions and drinking wine with all the
nobles of the ancient principality. From his conference
with the nobles he returned to his poor quarters,
wet to the skin, alternately shivering and burning with
fever, and ate his crust and sipped cold water and was
content—far happier, perhaps, than the knights had
been over their bumpers.</p>

<p>Now and then, but not often, the pastor or some
students and teachers would visit the castle, and then
Balzer was their guide. He knew the story of every
wall and of every crevice. If visitors gave him a few
kreutzers he was grateful. He would drop them in
his little savings bank, knowing that he should need
money in accomplishing the work appointed by destiny.
One day when Mosenbruch, the learned compiler of
dictionaries, visited the castle, he disputed Balzer’s historical
data; after some discussion the savant said that
no woman could save the castle because there was no
castle left to save. Philip was too angry to answer.
When Mosenbruch was ready to depart he offered his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</span>
gift. Philip rejected it. “I will not accept it,” he
thought; “the money of the castle fund must come to
me from unstained hands, the hands of people who
respect the castle.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Now the peasants loved the schoolmaster because
he made the children love the school. Philip was
grateful for their appreciation, but he denied that he
deserved it. “I rule the village and the children by
the power of the stronghold; personally I deserve
nothing!” he said firmly.</p>

<p>Sunday, when the day was fine, the youths and
maidens flocked to the castle, followed by their
elders, and, sitting before the castle, talked and sang.
Philip told them stories of the stronghold, and taught
them songs: “Lindenschmied,” “Schüttensam,” “Falkenstein,”
the “Castle in Austria,” and “Anne of Brittany.”
The people of the neighboring villages, too,
knowing what was passing on the heights, followed
those of Neideck, and then they would all sing together,
the strangers declaring that to sit in the courtyard
of Neideck was far pleasanter than to sit around
the public wells in their own villages. Among the
visitors was Lizzie, the daughter of Röderbauer of
Steinfurt. Röderbauer was a rich peasant; Lizzie was
his only child. She was strong and healthy, twenty
years old, and renowned for her beautiful blond hair—hair
so long that she could sit upon it!</p>

<p>While Philip told his stories, Lizzie gazed upon him
with wide-open eyes and half-open mouth, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</span>
what a wonderful man Burg Balzer must be to know
so much more than all the people round about. And
yet he was the “poor devil” of the parish! It pleased
Lizzie to think how wise he was, but it grieved her
to think how poor he was; she longed to do something
to help him. Philip was not slow to note that Lizzie
was constant in her visits. Every Sunday he saw her
blond hair and her pretty face, and it was not long
before he began to think of her night and day. In
his mind he addressed himself to her when he told
his romantic stories to the people; he gave her solos
to sing; he sang duets with her. At first they were
friends, then their friendship got to be known as a
“love affair,” and finally, without any one knowing it,
one day they exchanged promises. It was a secret;
but it was a betrothal nevertheless. Though such
things happen in other places as well as in old castles,
Philip was sure that his happiness had come through
the influences of his castle. When he appeared before
Röderbauer of Steinfurt to ask for his daughter,
Röderbauer replied: “While I live my daughter shall
not get one kreutzer from me! When I am dead she
may do as she pleases!”</p>

<p>As Röderbauer was not far beyond the age of forty,
and as he had never been sick, not even for a day, it
was plain enough that if Lizzie waited for his death
she would not at that time be a very lively bride.
However, Burg Balzer, knowing the character of rich
peasants, knew that Röderbauer was not to be moved.
Strong in his love, he was equally strong in his devotion
to his castle; Philip turned from Lizzie to his writings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</span>
“I will finish my history of Neideck,” he thought
bravely, and so as time went on he saved his money
and wrote his history.</p>

<p>Of publishers’ methods or of authors’ chances he
knew nothing. Röderbauer respected money and cared
nothing for fame—and yet—and yet!—Balzer knew
it would be by this book he would gain his wife.
Lizzie loved him; since the curse fell he had been the
first warder of Neideck to win the love of woman; so
Lizzie was the woman predestined to save the castle!
How it should come to pass he knew not; he felt that
he was but an instrument; <em>it was to be</em>. Meanwhile
he could love in secret and write history in secret, and
that was enough!</p>

<p>His appeal to Röderbauer had separated him from
his betrothed, and as he now saw her seldom he had
more time to devote to his writing. So resignation
and patience and the strength to endure his disappointment
all came from the castle.</p>

<p>He had written and copied fifty folio sheets when
one day the inspector of schools visited Neideck.
Philip had no cause to fear the visit. In fine weather
he had been sending the laziest pupil to the pasture,
but when the weather was bad they all flocked to the
school, where they drank in his teachings, and consequently
knew more than the children of other places.
The inspector was an antiquary. After the examination
the two men—the master and his chief—crawled
like beetles through the ruins. The inspector listened
as in a dream, while Philip, poorest of all his teachers,
told the story of the stronghold. The inspector’s interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</span>
filled the mystic with ecstasy, and in his excitement
he, Balzer, the most timid of men, found courage
to show his manuscript. With hands trembling, with
face flushed, he gave it to the inspector.</p>

<p><em>Twenty different conjectures concerning the meaning
of the name “Neideck.” All very plausible.</em></p>

<p>And the conclusion was that the name did not signify
after all: <em>eck</em> (a corner) where <em>neid</em> (envy)
dwelt, but a corner to be envied by all who could not
live in it—<em>Neideck</em>. The inspector admired Philip’s
handwriting: the conjectural structure was somewhat
uncertain; but on that foundation Balzer had raised
an edifice bolder than the architecture of the double
towers. The literary form of the manuscript was most
original, for, although Balzer had never studied literature,
his writing came as the spirit inspired it. Philip’s
castle had taught him how to write.</p>

<p>At that time Rousseau’s “Emile” was the book of
the hour. The inspector was an ardent follower of
Jean Jacques, and he found that the active principle
of the history of Neideck was the principle of the
work of Rousseau. Though Balzer had never heard
of Rousseau, yet all the former’s methods, so it seemed
to the inspector, showed the instinctive practise of
the philanthropic system of education. The analogy
was so complete that Rousseau’s book, that formed the
chief intellectual diet of the advocates of “sentimental,
enlightened pedagogy,” might readily pass as a very
natural and complete supplement to the work of Balzer.
The inspector’s opinion brought tears to Philip’s
eyes. “Good night,” he called back graciously; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</span>
Philip watched him as he disappeared farther and farther
down the slope of the mountain.</p>

<p>“<em>Good night!</em> What a day it has been! I have been
happy!” thought Philip—and for that, too, he thanked
his castle.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Four weeks after the inspector’s visit a letter came
for Balzer. He was offered the school at Ottenheim.
Ottenheim lay in the rich district of teeming pastures—“the
butter district.” So the school was twice as
important as that of Neideck. That same evening, too,
a neighbor stopped at the castle to offer Balzer his
congratulations on another “streak of luck,” the death
of Röderbauer. Röderbauer had climbed a tree to pick
cherries to make his celebrated cordial; he had fallen
from the tree and been picked up dead. Delicacy impelled
Balzer to deny that he saw luck in Röderbauer’s
death, but in his heart he knew that the event would
make his own life easier, and he could not find
any excuse for attributing this last blessing to his
castle.</p>

<p>He gave his pupils a three days’ vacation and set
off for Ottenheim, wondering if it would be possible
to live so far from Neideck. He was not sure of this.
As he passed the new castle, the home of the heirs and
owners of Neideck, a smile of pity flitted over his lips.
What a fall; from Neideck to Westerau! History had
made Neideck glorious; Westerau had no history! A
prince may build a castle, but even Omnipotence can
not give ancestry to an unfledged baron!—Philip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</span>
was shocked; pride in his castle had caused him to
blaspheme; he had cast a doubt upon Omnipotence!</p>

<p>Driving back these confusing thoughts, he went on
across the crest of the Dill Mountains, that looked
down upon the broad green plains, the well-kept, regularly
measured meadows, the corn-fields swaying in
the wind, and the highway lined with fruit trees. Set
on the verdant, gold-flecked carpet rested the villages
with red-tiled roofs. The church spires were glittering
in the sunlight. But it was tame! There were no
woods, no rocks, no stronghold. Not a ruin! The
long stretch of level land oppressed him, but he went
on. Arrived at Ottenheim, he saw the schoolroom;
large, light, limewashed. The windows looked out
on a playground; from the ground sprang four slim
young lindens; they looked like brooms standing on
their sticks. His heart quailed. Homesick dread
filled his soul. How could he live and teach in such
a place? He turned and fled.</p>

<p>At Steinfurt he stopped to salute the girl with
the long, fair hair. In her black dress, her long
lashes wet with tears, Lizzie was even prettier than
when she had visited Neideck. In his dust-stained
traveling coat (he had no other) Philip followed
Röderbauer’s coffin to the grave—and the peasants
envied him.</p>

<p>After the funeral he talked of the future with his
betrothed. His appointment to Ottenheim pleased the
girl, but she knew that she had money enough now to
build in Neideck. Philip declared that he would never
live in the butter district, where there were no woods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</span>
no rocks, no strongholds. His future, a great future,
lay in Neideck. He knew it.</p>

<p>“Such talk is foolish,” answered Lizzie, and they
quarreled; the girl told him that she would never live
in the lodge. She called the castle “old and ugly.”
She refused to marry him. Philip protested that he
would die a bachelor rather than go to Ottenheim. He
reminded Lizzie of her visits to Neideck and of the
beauty of the castle. Lizzie answered: “I did not go
there to see the castle; I went there to see you.” That
was too much! Philip set off for Neideck cut to the
heart. But he was not rash; he gave her time to think
it over. After two weeks he returned to Steinfurt—and
again they quarreled. “Whoever takes me must
take my castle!” said Philip; and Lizzie answered: “If
you do not love me more than you love the castle, I
do not want you!” Philip’s heart was heavy; Lizzie
thought less of the matter. Pride was mingled with
Philip’s sorrow. “The castle has done so much for
me,” thought he; “it has made me what I am. Even
if I have to renounce my love to keep my trust, I must
be faithful.” So he declined the offer of Ottenheim
and continued to appear before the world as the poorest
of the schoolmasters, the head of the smallest school
in Germany.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>From the eastern wing of the Renaissance Castle in
Westerau the view over the Felber Valley was beautiful;
far off one could see the rocky height where the
towers of Castle Neideck rose against the horizon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</span>
In that wing resided Princess Isabella, the ruling
prince’s younger daughter, with her lady-in-waiting,
Fräulein von Martigny.</p>

<p>The young Princess, only eighteen years old, often
gazed longingly toward those ancestral towers, wishing
she were there, to look far out over the open country,
and then to travel through it, on and on and on.
Here, in her father’s castle, with its aristocratic ennui,
she felt as if she were in prison. I wonder which is
the greater torture: a prison window that looks out
upon high walls, or one with a beautiful view into the
distance? One reminds us every hour that we are imprisoned;
the other that we can not get away. And
the Princess would have liked so much to fly away, but
at her father’s court the rules of etiquette were observed
as strictly as in a Spanish convent, particularly
with regard to ladies. Isabella’s sister had entered a
convent to escape the monotony of the castle, and in
the convent she had been more at ease than in the
castle.</p>

<p>There was some analogy between the conditions of
the warder of the old castle and the Princess of the
new castle. As with all his heart Balzer desired marriage
with Lizzie, but would not buy his happiness with
the sacrifice of his castle, so with all her heart the
Princess of the new castle desired liberty—to be free
from her father’s house—but she would not buy her
liberty by marriage with her cousin, Frederick, Count
Vierstein.</p>

<p>Everything slept at Westerau. When Isabella sat
in her luxurious room it seemed to her that all four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</span>
walls were yawning, and when she walked in the castle
garden all the trees seemed to sleep, and the gods and
goddesses of stone between the trimmed hedges of
hornbeam were surely snoring. She arose in the morning
at nine o’clock, because it was necessary for her
to rest from the preceding day’s ennui, and when they
put on her stockings while she was dressing, it often
took half an hour to proceed from the right to the
left foot.</p>

<p>During the day she was never alone, not one minute;
for Fräulein von Martigny, who was not only lady-in-waiting,
but took the place of a mother, never left her
side. A true feminine Minos in matters of etiquette,
the old lady was also nervous and irritable. When the
Princess had been washing and bathing during her
morning toilet, Fräulein always kept a few steps away,
asserting that she would just as easily catch cold by
going near a newly washed being as by walking over
a newly washed floor.</p>

<p>After the dressing hour came the reading hour.
Fräulein read aloud, in French, only classical authors
from the time of Louis the Great, and the very cadence
of the verses seemed to produce sleep. Then
followed the painting lesson. Court-painter Timothy
Niedermeyer taught the Princess to paint in water-colors,
and every one in the family received a bouquet
in water-colors as a birthday gift. This Niedermeyer
had a fine talent, but had become a mannerist. This
also was the result of ennui, for by princely decree he
had every year to deliver, in return for his salary,
twenty-four oil paintings, mostly family portraits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</span>
There were portraits of the Princess at all ages, in
every possible position and costume; the most recent
pictures showed her as an angel with wings, among
clouds; as an eighteen-year-old girl, blowing soap-bubbles
into the air, and as a shepherdess with
crook, leading a sheep by a red ribbon; these three
pictures had been sent to Vierstein, as gifts for the
intended bridegroom. The Princess was, in truth,
beautiful, but her life of utter seclusion had given to
her face the soft, languid beauty of a hot-house flower,
and as the artist, with a wish to flatter, had over-refined
the delicate features, the result was that the
child-angel-shepherdess head looked utterly expressionless.
Ennui is the hunger of the aristocrat; hunger
is the ennui of the common people; the painted face of
the Princess showed that she had never felt hungry,
but very often bored. Isabella was to marry the Count
of Vierstein, but did not wish to do so; and the Count
of Vierstein would have nothing to do with Isabella,
who was to be his bride. They were cousins, had
met as children, and Isabella had shed many a tear
over the wild boy, whose rough manner frightened
and troubled her. Later they lost sight of each other;
the Count traveled extensively and entered foreign
service. The two fathers had by letter, and on their
own responsibility, betrothed their children without
consulting those who were most concerned, although
the two castles were only a day’s journey apart.</p>

<p>They considered such action more suitable to their
rank than to permit an engagement from love, as
among ordinary people. The fine portraits of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</span>
court-painter were intended to arouse in the reluctant
Count some interest for his unwilling bride, but they
had the opposite effect. Nor did the half-length portrait
of the Count, that arrived at the same time in
Westerau, have any better success. This portrait represented
the young man as a hussar. Vierstein could
not boast of a court-painter—his court being interested
only in hunting and the army—so the picture
had been painted by a traveling artist, whose vigorous
brush had given the poor Count’s face a ferocious
expression. The Princess was frightened to tears, as
she had been when a child. And Fräulein von Martigny
made use of this fear to give background to the
cousin’s bad reputation. She hinted at a certain Potsdam
barrack atmosphere that Vierstein carried into
sitting-room and bedrooms; that no one over there
cared for anything but soldiers, horses, dogs. For
in her heart the Fräulein shared Isabella’s aversion
to this marriage, and would have preferred to see her
beloved foster child become an old maid. Then might
the Fräulein be to the end of her life Mistress of the
Robes at this dear court, whose ennui she was not
sensible of, although she did her utmost to promote it.</p>

<p>To be sure the painting and the painting lessons
were as tiresome as everything else in the castle, yet
a certain dramatic interest was attached to them—an
interest that was woefully lacking in the rest of the
day’s proceedings, which went like clockwork—and all
the clocks in the castle were correct. Every day the
Prince rode out at the same hour, on the same road,
and returned at the same minute. Breakfast was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</span>
served at eleven o’clock; at twelve o’clock they held
an audience, the Princess as well. Her lady-in-waiting
was careful to impress upon her beforehand how to
open the conversation. There were only three phrases
from which to select; Isabella sometimes wished to
add a fourth or fifth, but had not the courage to do so.</p>

<p>They dined at three o’clock. Conversation at table,
though the merest gossip, was very solemn. Isabella
discovered, in listening to it, that the people in the
town could not be quite such bores as were those in
the castle, for, at least, they furnished material for
conversation. She sometimes wished to become acquainted
with the wife of one of the officials or even
of a common tradesman, but Fräulein assured her that
that would be improper as well as unpleasant. “These
common people have such a peculiar odor,” she said,
taking a double dose of snuff. She always maintained
that it was one of the finest traits in the Landgrave of
Hesse, that he could not bear the odor of common
people.</p>

<p>After dinner the whole party went out for a walk;
they proceeded in pairs, the marshal with his staff
going before, two chasseurs with their carbines closing
the procession. Isabella would have preferred an
excursion to Neideck; they had even promised it to
her, but they never found time for it. Simply because
there was nothing to do, the hours were fully
occupied. This never-fulfilled promise increased the
Princess’s longing to see the charmed Castle of Neideck;
it became to her the symbol of freedom, ever
alluring, forever unattainable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</span></p>

<p>After the walk the Prince, following the example
of Louis XIV, fed and caressed his numerous dogs.
If her father was in an unusually good humor, Isabella
received permission to pat the dogs, a thing she
hated to do. Afterward Fräulein von Martigny never
failed to remind her that as Cousin Frederick owned
even a larger number of dogs, as Countess Vierstein
she would never be able to get away from dog-atmosphere.</p>

<p>The best comfort of the unfortunate, provided they
can sleep, is night. The Princess had a magnificent
canopy-bed, with the softest of pillows and the finest
silken covers. When a child lies comfortably in its
little bed, it is often said to be lying there “like a
princess.” The saying did not originate with Princess
Isabella, for she felt no comfort even in bed. She
wished to sleep in the dark, but it was considered
proper for her to have a Dutch night-lamp burning
in her own bedroom, and a German lamp in the one
adjoining, where her maid slept. And from the 15th
of October to the 15th of April open fires were kept
burning throughout the night in both rooms; such were
the palace regulations. So the poor Princess often lay
awake, counting the strokes of the big castle clock
and of all the other numerous clocks in the rooms,
following one another “like clockwork.” Her whole
young life seemed to her like one long sleepless night.</p>

<p>It was in the month of May. The nights were now
growing shorter, fortunately; but Isabella was still
awake at one o’clock, staring about her with wide-open
eyes. She noticed a small red book on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</span>
window-sill, an unusual sight in these rooms, where
nothing was ever left lying about. What kind of a
book could it be? All the books in the castle were
bound in blue. She slipped out of bed to look at it.</p>

<p>The red cover was in bad taste and overdecorated;
the leaves were gilt-edged, but the paper was bad, like
blotting paper, and the print was poor and blurred.
The title was: “Notable description and history of
the princely Castle of Neideck, brought to light by
Philip Balzer, schoolmaster and student of the history
of his fatherland.”</p>

<p>The Princess went to bed again, and, by the light
of her very good Dutch night-lamp, began to read
this little book. Scarcely had she finished the few
pages which treated of the origin and twenty-five
meanings of the name “Neideck,” when she began to
feel drowsy, and when she reached page ten she fell
asleep, and slept soundly until late in the morning.</p>

<p>After this she decided to read a little of the book
every evening; she also inquired as to whom it belonged
and how it came to be in her room.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In due time Burg Balzer finished his “history,” and
even got it printed, a harder task than the writing.
There was only one printing office in the principality,
and this belonged to the court bookbinder Zöllner in
Westerau. Zöllner, owner also of a toy store and circulating
library, printed every year the “Court, State,
and House Almanac of Westerau,” and this was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</span>
extent of his printing venture; he could never be induced
to risk any other literary undertaking. Philip
had foreseen that, and offered to cover all necessary
expenses with the contents of his savings-box. The
castle fund, which had been collecting for twelve years,
amounted now to exactly two florins and eighteen
kreutzers.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But Herr Zöllner was not satisfied. Philip,
though surprised that books could cost so much, did
not lose courage. He, knowing that peasants pay their
rent partly in money and produce the rest in manual
labor and labor of their teams, proposed to the bookbinder
to pay him by the same method, to write out
bills and dunning letters, line school copybooks, and
perform other tasks, until all expenses had been paid.
The bookbinder agreed, and Balzer, with a heavy sigh,
became his publisher’s drudge, as also more famous
authors have been. Piles of the bookbinder’s work
were carried to Neideck every Saturday, but the pile
of Philip’s own book in Westerau remained untouched.
Philip bore his burden heroically; he was slaving for
his castle, that was enough for Philip. He had not
neglected, however, to present some elegantly bound
copies to the ruling princes of his own and adjoining
lands. At first he expected a few gold snuff-boxes
in return, then, at least, some kind acknowledgment
by letter; but nothing came.</p>

<p>The Prince of Westerau had given the book to his
valet, because it had come uncalled for and not in
proper form; all gifts from his subjects, as long as
they were of no special value, went the same way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</span></p>
<p>The valet found the book so uninteresting that he
passed it on to Isabella’s maid. The girl, feeling life
at court even more tedious than this book, first read
a little in it, then forgot it, leaving it in the Princess’s
room, where, during a sleepless night, as we have seen,
it fell at last into the right hands.</p>

<p>The Princess was glad to hear something more definite
about the enchanted castle, and was surprised to
read of all the strange events that had taken place
there—a small history of the world in itself—and of
the numerous historical monuments still in existence
there. The French books with which Fräulein von
Martigny tormented her every day took her to Rome,
Athens, Mexico, and other places, for which she cared
nothing; it pleased her at last to be able to read about
what was nearest her home, about the mystery upon
which she looked out from her own windows. The
beginning of the book had a soothing effect, even
helped her to sleep; later on it became more interesting,
and toward the end quite exciting. Sometimes
the author was very comical, just when he wished to
be very impressive; but he always meant well, and was
very enthusiastic. The Princess became interested in
an author who could make her laugh without quite
laughing at him. In the preface the writer offers himself
as guide to every visitor in Neideck, by day or
night, in rain or sunshine; and when Isabella closed
the book she was more than willing to have such a
guide through the ruins—in moonshine if possible. At
times the book spoke like a prophet; for example, on
page 112, where it said quite mysteriously: “A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</span>
may build a house or a castle, but this house or castle
will build up and mold the man who lives in it. Apparently
time has come to a standstill in the old stronghold;
but only apparently, for time is not only ever
moving, but also moves others; it moves the castle
toward growth and age. The castle is really a living
being, mysteriously connected with the fate of the ruling
family, of the country, and perhaps also with the
fate of a humble subject, who does not yet reveal his
identity. These ruins have their spirit; not a ghost, but
<em>the</em> spirit of the castle, put into it by every one who, led
by some vague impulse, approaches in all sincerity so
mighty a monument, receiving back from it in higher
potency what all have put there. In this way the
curses of the poor evicted women have become reality;
two of these curses are already fulfilled, and the third
will surely come to pass when the predestined lady of
the castle appears, to bring for the first time after a
hundred years love and blessing, to save the castle and
put men to shame. Who is this noble lady, and when
will she appear?” With this question the book closed.
As mentioned before, the Princess was much excited
by these words. Until now, to feel bored and to marry
her hateful cousin seemed to be her only vocation in
life. The first she was not responsible for, the second
she intended to be fully responsible for. But now she
began to wonder if she were not called upon to save
the castle? It was not quite clear to her what there
was about it to be saved, but that did not matter. She
had found her vocation in life: she was going to save
something. To begin with, she must first see the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</span></p>

<p>A new spirit of insubordination awoke in her. Was
it not her natural right to see the home of her ancestors?
and why should she be defrauded of that right?
For the first time she studied her own situation, without
prejudice, as a matter of principle, and she discovered
that she was kept imprisoned, led by leading-strings,
bored, and made stupid. “The house molds
the person,” she had read. Yes, indeed, the gilded
cage of this tiresome castle had made a puppet of her.
But that was over now. A strong spirit of defiance
began to stir in that pretty head; Rousseau’s spirit was
filling her, too, with fire and flame, and all this through
the influence of poor Burg Balzer, who knew nothing
at all about Rousseau.</p>

<p>It was just at this time, when the first storm of rebellion
was shaking the Princess’s world of thought,
that the arrangements for her marriage were to be
completed. The visit by the young Count had been
announced three times, and three times apologies had
been sent for his not coming. The young man, just
returned from his travels, could not be induced to go
to Westerau; he shuddered when he remembered the
days he had spent there as a child. In spite of this
reluctance, unflattering and unpromising as it was, the
two fathers remained firm, and the young people had
to submit. The Princess, though hoping the Count
would remain at Blocksberg, was yet annoyed that he
did not care to see her. She declared to her father
that she would say “No!” even on the steps of the
altar, and that no power on earth could make her go
to Vierstein. Such open rebellion had never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</span>
known before, while the reasons with which Isabella
supported her right to a voice in the matter were simply
unthinkable. The Prince ceased to recognize his
gentle daughter. He sent for her responsible guardian,
Fräulein von Martigny, to hear what she had
to say about this paroxysm of revolt. The frightened
lady told him that she <em>had</em> noticed a certain obstinacy
and extravagance in Isabella for several days; it had
worried her greatly, but she had not been able to
discover the cause. The Prince, accustomed to have
everything settled according to his wishes promptly
and definitely, now commanded Fräulein von Martigny
to take Isabella for a walk in the garden. Within an
hour he would look for the report that Isabella had
been brought to her senses.</p>

<p>But instead of coming to an understanding, the two
ladies had a serious quarrel; they did not raise their
voices; their gestures were quite within the rules of
finest etiquette; but underneath it all poisoned arrows
and sharp thrusts were exchanged.</p>

<p>They had been walking for more than half an hour
up and down, under the orange trees in front of the
castle, when suddenly they heard a confused sound
of angry voices coming from the gate. The two
ladies stopped: a man with long hair <em>sans</em> powder and
cue, in shabby clothes, half rustic, half citified-looking,
was trying to enter the castle, while footmen were
driving him back. He held a petition in his hand, and
kept calling out: “I must see the Prince! I <em>must</em> see
the Prince!” The footmen told him that it was impossible,
and would have quickly overpowered him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">[Pg 721]</span>
when, seeing the Princess, the man broke loose and
ran straight toward the ladies.</p>

<p>“Gracious Princess!” he cried, quite out of breath.
“I am the schoolmaster of Neideck! Help me! I
must speak to your father, the Prince! Danger is
threatening!”</p>

<p>In great indignation Fräulein von Martigny drew
the Princess away, and the servants again laid hands
on the excited man. But when Isabella heard his
name, she actually ordered the footmen to release him.
At such independence on Isabella’s part, Fräulein stood
like a statue turned to stone. Isabella now asked the
schoolmaster for an explanation. His words were not
courtier-like, but they sounded all the more natural for
that. “Imagine, Princess!” he said, “the castle of Neideck
is to be demolished, blown up, leveled to the
ground. It was the steward who suggested it, and the
Prince has given his assent. They will begin work
next week. Think of it! The home of your ancestors,
the country’s stronghold, the most beautiful edifice—in
one word, Neideck is to fall! And what
makes the blow still more unbearable is the fact that
it is I who am the cause of it, I, who put the plan into
the steward’s head! In my history of the castle—”</p>

<p>“I have read it,” interrupted the Princess, smiling
graciously, while a smirk of pleased authorship passed
over Philip’s rapt features. He continued:</p>

<p>“In my history I explained the name of the Hasen
Tower; perhaps you know that the present steward
Haas is a grandson of the one who cut his throat in
one of the rooms there. I had to tell all that, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</span>
truth is the first duty of the historian, nothing but
truth; the man who tells only half the truth is a liar
through and through. Well, the steward is angry,
and says that I have insulted his grandfather in his
grave; and that I did it in print, moreover, which is
worse. He wished to dismiss me from my position as
teacher, but the inspector, my kind protector, interfered.
Now, as the steward can not send me away,
he has determined that the castle shall be destroyed.
He alleges that it interferes with the traffic. The
traffic! Why, you can’t find any traffic over there,
even if you searched for it with spectacles. He asserts,
too, that it gives shelter to tramps—I am the only one
who lives there; that it threatens to collapse of itself
any day. Well, then, if that is the case, why does he
want to demolish it? But those are idle pretexts; the
true reason is his grandfather’s suicide. See how one
evil deed leads to another! The Prince has agreed
only because he has been falsely informed. But I will
explain everything to his Highness. If that stronghold
were destroyed, it would be a disgrace to the
whole land, and it would be not only my fault, but my
death, too! Help me to an audience, gracious Princess,
an immediate audience with the Prince!” Fräulein
von Martigny called the footmen back and told
them to take that mad fellow away, but Isabella interposed:
“My dear schoolmaster, follow me!” Making
a graceful motion with her fan, she advanced to the
entrance-hall and up the stairway, Balzer following
with head erect. In the mean while Fräulein was
calling for <em>eau de lavande</em>, fell in a swoon, so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</span>
footmen had to support her instead of the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The Princess was taking a bold course; but one who
breaks the chain is stronger than one who has never
worn it. When Isabella entered her father’s room, the
Prince thought she had come, dutifully as usual, to
submit herself to his will, with the lady who had influenced
her following. How astonished he was to see
Burg Balzer’s face instead of Fräulein von Martigny’s!
He gave the imprudent man one piercing look, whereupon
Isabella began at once to explain, describing in
a few words the whole scene, and begging mercy for
the castle, while Balzer fell on his knees and, holding
his petition aloft, cried: “Mercy! Mercy!”</p>

<p>With great self-possession the Prince touched the
bell. When the valet entered, the Prince ordered him
to see that this impertinent intruder of a schoolmaster
leave the castle at once. It was done.</p>

<p>Alone with his daughter, he gave her a sharp lecture.
Isabella acknowledged that his reproaches were
just, but was not her intercession for the castle also
just? She unfolded her reasons with such enthusiasm
that the old Prince listened in astonishment to an eloquence
never before suspected in his daughter. Fired
by the spirit of Philip’s book, she saw in the castle a
living being, and prophesied that in vain would remorse
follow its destruction, as if one were to kill a
man and then call in the doctor.</p>

<p>But the Prince was inexorable. Though Isabella’s
eloquence had made a strong impression upon him, it
was also quite different from the one intended. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</span>
could not help thinking that if the Count only saw
the girl thus passionately excited he would like her
better than he had heretofore; he remembered, from
times long past, that young people admire strong passion.
This led to another thought—only he was not
quite sure that it would be proper to express it. He
said at last in his coldest voice: “If you care so much
for the castle, let us exchange. I give you the castle
and you give me your ‘Yes’ for the Count!”</p>

<p>But now the Princess burned in righteous indignation.
She called it a shameless proposition, and
affirmed that she would never marry her cousin.</p>

<p>It was her last word. Her father, too, had nothing
more to say. The family jar was over.</p>

<p>After that events moved quickly. The Prince gave
orders that for criminally breaking the peace of the
princely household and of the palace the mad schoolmaster
of Neideck must leave the castle within twenty-four
hours. Furthermore, the demolition of the castle
must commence as soon as possible. The Princess,
too, was ordered to her own room for an indefinite
time, and the strictest watchfulness exacted from her
lady-in-waiting, for the unfortunate girl had shown
traces of a mental disorder that could be cured only
by a life of utter seclusion. As Count Vierstein was
expected on the following Sunday, the Prince wished,
by any means, to prepare Isabella for his coming, and
thus to awaken love for him in her heart. His orders
were promptly executed. The dismissed schoolmaster
disappeared from his little house. He had not left the
castle, however, for he was hiding in the secret vault,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">[Pg 725]</span>
where in the year 1757 he had faced the siege without
besiegers. There he spent all his days and nights, except
in the evening, when he would steal out into the
village, and the peasants would give him something to
eat, keeping the matter a profound secret, so that the
steward should not continue to persecute him.</p>

<p>The mental condition of the poor schoolmaster, formerly
so happy and content, was pitiful. He never
thought of his own misery, only of the ruin that threatened
the castle, all through his fault. He had renounced
his love, only to bring ruin to the castle;
collected the fund, only to see the castle demolished;
written his history—to have those glorious towers of
Neideck blown up! Tormented by remorse, he made
up his mind, if it should ever really come to <em>that</em>, he
would be at the bridge leading to the Hasen Tower at
the right moment.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Princess Isabella, too, was not enjoying a very happy
time of it. For six days she did not see a human being
save her maid and Fräulein von Martigny. That old
lady was preaching repentance in every possible key
and tune; Isabella did not listen. In these sermons
Count Vierstein was not mentioned as often as he
should have been, but the old lady continued to remark
at frequent intervals that he would come the following
Sunday without fail. Isabella was silent. The readings
from the French classics were three times as long
as usual; Isabella did not notice it. She only thought
and thought of all the suffering she had endured in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</span>
this stupid castle from her childhood on. She determined
to get away from it at any cost. Yet she did
not know where to go.</p>

<p>Saturday night had come. Fräulein was just reading
in Boileau’s tenth epistle: “In vain do I stop you;
my remonstrance is vain—go, depart!” when a distant,
dull thunder shook the air, rattling all the windows.
The old lady was startled, but kept on reading all the
louder; she knew, it seemed, what the noise meant, and
was trying to divert her prisoner’s attention. But it
was not necessary: Isabella was so deep in thought
that she had no more heard the report than she had
the verses of Boileau.</p>

<p>It soon grew dark, and every one went to bed early,
as usual. Isabella slept very little; at four o’clock the
bright sunshine awakened her again. It was the Sunday
at last on which the Count was to appear. She
looked through the open window out over the dewy
landscape; her eyes sought the distant castle, the only
object which she ever watched with interest, often
with tears in her eyes; but, oh, horrible! the castle
had only one tower left! At first the Princess thought
that the sun, shining into her face, had caused an
optical illusion. She ran for her spyglass; then she
recognized the sad truth: the castle had now but one
tower, the other, the Hasen Tower, had been blown
up last night when that dull report made the windows
rattle.</p>

<p>Isabella was beside herself with grief and anger.
She had firmly believed that her father would show
mercy to the castle, if only to please her, and she hoped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_727">[Pg 727]</span>
that such a sign of his love might lead to a reconciliation
and help her to begin a new life in her father’s
house, one more worthy of living. Such had been her
thoughts during rare and more hopeful hours. And
every day she had been looking upon the still intact
castle as a promise of the future; but now, to-day, the
first tower had fallen, her father remained unmoved,
and—the Count was coming! She dressed herself,
threw a shawl over her head, and stole on tiptoe from
the room, down the staircase into the castle-yard.
No one noticed her at this early hour. A small gate
stood open; she hurried out, not knowing what she
was doing or whither she was going; at least, she had
once more willed something and done something. The
fresh air was inspiring, and her spirits felt uplifted on
the wings of the morning wind.</p>

<p>Instinctively she walked in the direction of the castle,
at first hurrying like a fugitive, but soon moderating
her pace, for, though no one recognized her, still
she was attracting the attention of the few people she
happened to meet. At last she asked herself, where
would she go? Her resolution was quickly formed:
to Neideck. And what then? She did not know.
But once up in the castle, she would be far away
from her own home, and for the present that was
enough.</p>

<p>Not accustomed, however to such long tramps, she
soon grew tired, her knees shook, her eyes filled with
tears; but even then she did not give up, and two
hours later arrived at Neideck, where in the castle-yard
she fell to the ground, completely exhausted. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</span>
grew dark before her eyes; she heard the ringing of
the church-bells, the humming of bees; she noticed the
fragrance of the elder blossoms, but she did not realize
where she was, and lay as in a dream.</p>

<p>A voice roused her. Some one asked anxiously:
“What is the matter, young woman?” She looked
up. A young man in traveling clothes, with boots and
spurs, stood before her, looking at her kindly. She
did not answer, but searched him sharply with her
eyes; there was something familiar in his face, but
she could not remember where she had seen it.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here so early in the morning?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I am looking for the schoolmaster,” stammered
Isabella. It was all she could think of.</p>

<p>“I am looking for him, too,” remarked the young
man. “This Burg Balzer is certainly a remarkable
man: something of a fool, no doubt, like all original
people. But he no longer lives here; he has been dismissed
and sent away, as one of the peasants told me;
sent away because he conducted himself very improperly
toward the Princess Isabella.”</p>

<p>“That is not true!” said Isabella. “At least, not as
far as the Princess is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” the stranger assured her. “There is no
joking with this Isabella; she <em>is</em> such a bore!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is more bored than boring,” replied
Isabella.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at her attentively. “Who are
you, I wonder, that you know so much about this?
Perhaps a lady’s maid from the castle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</span></p>

<p>She stammered timidly: “Yes.” She had learned
so little, did not know how to tell even a lie.</p>

<p>“Well, if that is so, I wish you would tell me a
little about your mistress. I heard that she was quite
a nice-looking puppet, pulled by a string, either by her
father or her lady-in-waiting. Is she not going to
marry Count Vierstein in the near future?”</p>

<p>“She is not quite such a puppet as you think!” cried
Isabella, very indignantly, and in quite another tone.
“The string is broken; she is <em>not</em> going to marry this
wild Count, not under any circumstances!”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! Is the Count really so wild? And how
do you know that?”</p>

<p>“He lives only among hunters, horses, dogs, and
soldiers, and roams the woods all day long!”</p>

<p>“So, so! And why are you roaming through old
castles all alone, my highly virtuous young woman?”</p>

<p>“I? Oh, I wished to see the schoolmaster and the—the
tower that was blown up yesterday,” Isabella answered,
very much embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, I intended to see the tower too; the schoolmaster’s
book interested me—”</p>

<p>“Have you read his book? That was the reason <em>I</em>
came here,” interrupted Isabella.</p>

<p>“It is an absurd book,” the stranger went on. “But
the man’s feeling for his castle is true and strong.
After reading his book you feel drawn toward this
place, whether you wish to come or not.”</p>

<p>“That is just what happened to me,” whispered the
Princess.</p>

<p>“There is a sentimental maid for you,” thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</span>
stranger. “They are becoming very frequent in our
philosophical century.”</p>

<p>“That young man has a good heart and clear head,”
thought Isabella. As far back as she could remember
he was the first person who had ever shown her any
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Oh, see here,” he suddenly broke out aloud and
straightened himself. “I can not play a part. I am
Count Vierstein, whom you called ‘the wild Count.’
And if I do roam about in God’s nature all day long,
I get more joy and pleasure out of it than do your
pale people who live indoors. I can see the sun rising
here from this enchanted castle, as I did to-day—and—I
am furious at the people over there in Westerau
who, without further ado, are barbarous enough to
blow up the home of their ancestors. You may tell
your mistress so; I shall see her myself to-day, but
shall not have much to say to her, certainly nothing
about this.”</p>

<p>For a while Isabella stood speechless with terror.
But the Count did not look at all wicked; in fact, he
was quite handsome; and not nearly so ill-mannered as
Fräulein von Martigny had described him; on the contrary,
he seemed to her kind and very tactful. This
consideration lessened her terror. Should she tell
him? But shame closed her lips. Finally she controlled
herself and whispered: “Are you really on the
way to Westerau? Several times you have been expected
there, but always in vain.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a rough road, this journey after a
bride!” the Count sighed. “However, I must go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</span>
through with it; my father wishes it, and children
must obey their parents, so says the Bible. But there
is a limit to our obedience; I will go to Westerau and
do all that is necessary and proper, but if I then dislike
this Princess as much as I do from a distance—and I
have little doubt of that—and if she herself intends to
give me, as you say, a very decided refusal—then I
can ride back home with a light and happy heart, having
done my duty. My attendants are awaiting me
down in the village. It is too early to make a call,
and I wish once more to breathe freely here in Burg
Balzer’s incomparable castle before I start on the
rough road I have to travel. There, now, you know
my whole history!”</p>

<p>Isabella drew the shawl closer over her head and
looked out into the valley. She saw there a group of
horsemen, followed by a carriage; the horsemen were
galloping toward the castle, and in the lead, as they
came nearer, she recognized her father. With an imploring
cry she turned to the Count: “Save me! That
is my father there, the Prince! I am Isabella. Save
me, protect me from my father. Do not let them take
me back into that hateful castle; it would kill me!”</p>

<p>The Count was covered with surprise. “You are
really Isabella, my dear cousin? But you don’t look
at all like your pictures, and your speech is quite different
from your letters. But why are you so afraid
of your father. Did you run away from him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, because he tried to make me marry—you!”</p>

<p>“Well,” thought the Count, “she at least has a will
of her own, and wishes to refuse me in her own way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</span></p>

<p>“But not only on that account am I afraid,” the
Princess continued, “but because I was shut into my
room as punishment for wishing to save the castle and
for taking the schoolmaster to my father on my own
responsibility!”</p>

<p>“On your own responsibility?” the Count repeated
very cheerfully. “Then you <em>did</em> run away after all?”
Isabella did not answer. “Why did you not run away
long ago? We would have known each other so much
sooner. And, and—are you often so excited as you
are to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; that is only here in Neideck; below, in the
castle, it is very different.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said the Count, “it is the bracing air
that does it! You must be out of doors more, ride
horseback, go hunting; then you will get rosy cheeks!
By the way, the air in Vierstein is much better than
it is down there in Westerau!”</p>

<p>But the poor girl only kept on imploring, “My
father! Save me!” All at once they heard a voice
whisper, “Quick, come here, this is the best hiding-place
you can find! I wished to keep it a secret from
every one, but to save the gracious Princess I gladly
sacrifice my secret, my head, everything! Come here,
the entrance is not far away.”</p>

<p>The Count turned and saw a strange figure, that
would have made him laugh if he had not been provoked.
“What does the fellow mean?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir, I am Burg Balzer, whom you
came to see. Sitting under the elder-bush here, I
could not help hearing the whole conversation. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</span>
beg you to forgive me! But come, waste no more
time!”</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” answered the Count coolly, “we
will look at your vault some other time; on the contrary,
you had better come over here, where I can
protect both of you. I am not used to hiding.”</p>

<p>The Prince rode into the castle yard; his foaming
horse reared in front of the group: Count Vierstein
in the middle, at his right the Princess, at his left
Burg Balzer.</p>

<p>At first the Prince did not recognize the Count; then
answering the latter’s bow, he exchanged a few words
with him, surprised at meeting him here and under
such circumstances. After a while the Prince turned
to Isabella: “Come here, you shameless girl!” And
then to the Count: “Unheard-of things have happened,
cousin! And before I do my duty as host, I
must do my duty as father. Down there at the foot
of the hill a carriage is awaiting you, Isabella; the
curtains are closely drawn. You will step into the
carriage; Fräulein von Martigny is expecting you;
everything is so arranged that you can drive home
and reach your room without being seen. A Princess
of Westerau, who ran away! Who ever heard of such
a thing in the whole history of our family!”</p>

<p>Firmly, though very respectfully, Count Vierstein
came forward. “Forgive me, most gracious prince
and cousin, if I do not give up the Princess to you;
at least, not against her will. She has placed herself
under my protection, and as a man of honor I must
grant it to her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</span></p>

<p>The Prince was astounded completely. What! Isabella
had placed herself under the Count’s protection,
and at the same time had run away only to escape the
Count.</p>

<p>Burg Balzer, taking advantage of his bewilderment,
pressed forward, forgot his fear of horses, until almost
touching that of the Prince, and begged for mercy
toward his castle. For answer the Prince called to
his outrider: “Drive this fool down the mountain with
your whip!”</p>

<p>Again the Count interceded: “This man, too, is
under my protection, and I beg your Highness to
leave him to me for the present!”</p>

<p>“My dear cousin,” laughed the Prince angrily, “do
you claim sovereign rights over my family and my
subjects? Perhaps I am no longer master here on my
own soil!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” answered the Count, “I would be very
much pleased if you would place that, too, under my
protection! The castle would be a perfect gem in
my dear cousin’s dowry, and I am beginning to hope
that she may not repulse this wild fellow when once
she comes to know him better!”</p>

<p>“What! Courting and marriage contract here in the
open road? Preposterous!” said the Prince. But all
at once he seemed to be in the best of humors. Burg
Balzer pulled the Count’s sleeve and whispered mysteriously:
“I have discovered the most beautiful place
for the wedding ceremony; it is right here under our
feet.” Even the Prince was listening now. “While
I was in hiding, and having nothing else to do, I succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</span>
in clearing out the rubbish from the passageway,
and oh, joy! I found a beautiful crypt under the
old chapel. For centuries it had been buried underneath,
and it has three heavy antique columns, the capitals
of which are ornamented with eagles and lions—”</p>

<p>“A wedding in the cellar? Preposterous!” interrupted
the Prince. “You are a fool, schoolmaster!
There! I have called you by mistake ‘schoolmaster’;
you may be one again! A man’s word is as good as
his bond!”</p>

<p>As this did not seem the proper place for further
discussion, the Prince decided to lead his daughter
to the carriage and to accompany her with his attendants
to the castle. The Count was to stay here about
two hours longer—perhaps visit the crypt—in order
to give the people in Westerau time to prepare a reception
with all honors. Everything else could then
be arranged in proper form.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Four weeks later the schoolmaster, who had received
by decree the additional dignity of castellan in Neideck,
ordered ten men to come to the castle yard and raise
from the well the old cannon that had been buried there
since 1757. After three days’ labor they succeeded in
dragging it out and hoisting it into its old place near
the castle gate, ready to salute at the wedding of Princess
Isabella and her cousin Frederick, which was to
take place the following day in the chapel of Castle
Westerau.</p>

<p>While Balzer was leaning against the cannon, in a
very comfortable and contemplative frame of mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</span>
the inspector came up the mountain, put his hand on
the schoolmaster’s shoulder, and said: “Well, schoolmaster,
what about your prophecy of the lady of high
rank who was to save the castle? It seems to me the
Princess did <em>not</em> do it after all, and the Count did.
And who are the men that have been put to shame?”</p>

<p>Philip replied: “Count or countess, it does not matter,
so long as the castle is saved! But it is a pity
they did not let that tower stand one day longer; it
could have lasted a thousand years to come. Prophecies
never are fulfilled to the letter, or people would
all be superstitious. With regard to the humiliated
men—well, what about the steward and the Prince
himself? Only one must not even think of that, far
less say so. After all, we can see in all this again
how a just power guides the fate of men as well as
of castles. Neideck has always been a good, true
stronghold: in its first youth it was the cradle of our
ruling family; in the prime of its existence it was a
place of refuge for all around; now it has grown old
and has retired into private life. But even so it has
given to our Princess an excellent husband, and to a
poor schoolmaster the prospect of a happy old age.
May it prosper for many years to come.”</p>

<p><em>Heyse, creator in the art of poetry, fiction, and
the drama, is opposed to the new materialism.</em></p>

<p><em>First known as one of Germany’s most original
writers of narrative poetry, he gradually
worked his way into the short story. Brandes,
most influential of living critics, once said of
these “Novellen” of Heyse’s: “The Novelle,
as he has made it, is an entirely original and
independent creation, his actual property.”</em></p>

<p><em>Heyse was born in Berlin in 1830. After
devoting himself to the study of languages,
he settled in Munich, and with a collection of
“Märchen” began that remarkable series of
tales which he has brought, as Robert König
says, to such genuine artistic perfection.
Popular as they all are, the two best are
thought to be “L’Arrabiata” and “The Young
Girl of Treppi,” in which his peculiar talent,
the portrayal of strong, passionate feminine
nature, is signally displayed.</em></p>

<p><em>Heyse’s style has been called the most perfect
of modern Germany.</em></p>

<p class="center p2b">Translated by R. W. Howes,<br>

<p>On a height of the Apennines where the mountains
rise between Tuscany and the northern
part of the Papal States stands a lonely village
of herdsmen called Treppi. The paths that lead
up to it are none of them accessible by wagon. The
road for post and vetturino, away toward the south,
many an hour’s travel, goes winding in and out over
the mountains in a wide, roundabout course. By way
of Treppi pass only the peasants who have business
with the herdsmen, and occasionally a painter or pedestrian
who wishes to avoid the highways, and during
the night-time the contrabbandieri, or smugglers, with
their pack-horses that know better than any of them
the way over the rocky passes leading to the desolate
village.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of October, a time when the
evenings on these heights usually grow clearer. But
now, after the heat of the day, a fine mist had rolled
up out of the ravines and was spreading itself slowly
over the bare, rocky outlines of the majestic highlands.
It was perhaps nine o’clock at night. In the lowly,
scattered huts of stone, which by day were guarded
only by the very old women and the very young children,
still feebly glimmered the lights of their hearth-fires.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">[Pg 740]</span>
Around the hearths, over which the big kettle
swung, the herdsmen and their families lay sleeping;
the dogs stretched themselves beside the ashes; on a
heap of hides some sleepless old grandmother was still
sitting up, perhaps, mechanically plying her spindle
back and forth while she mumbled prayers or rocked
a child that slept restlessly in its cradle. Through
holes in the walls, as big as your hand, the night air
oozed damp and earthy, and from the hearth-fire that
was quickly burning out, smothered by the fog, the
smoke choked thickly back and rolled along the ceiling
of the huts without seeming to trouble the old woman
in the least. After a while she, too, slept as well as
she could, with her eyes wide open.</p>

<p>In one home alone was there sign of life. Like the
others, this hut was but one story high; but the stones
were better laid, the door was wider and higher, and
against the broad, square building that formed the
dwelling proper were supported various sheds, lean-tos
stalls, and a well-bricked oven. Before the door of the
house stood a group of packed horses, from whose
noses a young lad was tugging away at the empty
meal-bags, while from the house came six or seven
armed men out into the mist and hastily got their
horses ready. As they started, a very old dog that
was lying near the door waved his tail in a leisurely
fashion; then he lifted himself wearily from the ground
and swung slowly into the hut, where the fire was still
burning brightly. By the hearth stood his mistress, facing
the fire, her straight figure motionless, her arms
hanging down by her hips. As the dog touched her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</span>
hand with his soft nose, she turned, startled out of
a reverie. “Fuoco,” she said, “poor dog, you are
sick!” The dog whined and moved his tail gratefully.
Then he crept near to the hearth onto an old hide and
stretched himself there, coughing and moaning.</p>

<p>In the mean time some of the servants had come in
and seated themselves around the great table before
the empty platters which the departing contrabbandieri
had just left. An old maid-servant now filled them
again with polenta from the great kettle, and taking
her own platter sat down with the others. As they ate,
not a word was spoken; the fire crackled, the dog
moaned hoarsely in his sleep, the grave young girl sat
down on the stone slab of the hearth, leaving untouched
the small plate of polenta which the maid had placed
before her, and gazed about the hall, lost in self-forgetfulness.
The mist was now standing before the
door like a white wall. But behind the edge of the
crags the half-moon rose clear into the heavens.</p>

<p>Up the street came a sound like the beating of hoofs
and footsteps. “Pietro!” called the young mistress of
the house in a quiet, reminding tone. A tall fellow
rose quickly from the table and disappeared into
the fog.</p>

<p>The footsteps and voices were now heard coming
nearer; at length the horse stopped before the hut.
Still a little while and three men appeared under the
doorway and entered with a curt “good evening.”
Pietro approached the young woman who was gazing
without interest into the fire. “They are two men from
Porretta,” he said to her, “without any merchandise;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</span>
they are guiding a signor over the mountains, whose
passport is not in order.”</p>

<p>“Nina!” called the young woman. The old serving-maid
got up and came toward the hearth.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that they only want to eat, padrona,”
continued the fellow. “Maybe the signor can have
a night’s lodging, too. He wishes to go no farther
before daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Make up a straw bed for him in the lean-to.”
Pietro nodded and went back to the table.</p>

<p>The three had taken their places without the servants
deigning to give them any particular attention.
Two of them were contrabbandieri, well armed, their
cloaks thrown lightly about them, their hats drawn well
down over their foreheads. They nodded a friendly
greeting to the others, as to old acquaintances, and
after they had given place to their companion, they
made the sign of the cross, and began to eat.</p>

<p>The gentleman who had come with them ate nothing.
He removed the hat from his high brow, passed
his hand through his hair, and let his eyes wander over
the place and the company. On the walls he read the
sacred texts drawn in charcoal, saw in the corner the
picture of the Madonna with the little lamp burning
before it, and close by the fowls asleep on their perches;
then the ears of corn, strung in rows, hanging from
the ceiling; a board with jugs and wicker bottles on it,
hides and baskets arranged in rows one upon the other.
At last his eyes were arrested by the young woman at
the hearth. Her dark profile showed severe and beautiful
against the flickering glow of the fire, a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</span>
mass of black braids coiled low on her neck, her hands
were lying locked together over one knee, while her
other foot rested on the stone floor of the hall. What
her age was he could not guess. But by her bearing
he knew that she was mistress of the house.</p>

<p>“Have you any wine in the house, padrona?” he
then asked. Scarcely had he spoken these words when
the young girl sprang up as if struck by lightning, and
stood rigidly by the hearth with both arms supporting
her against the ledge. At the same instant the
dog, too, started out of his sleep. A savage growl
broke from his coughing breast. The stranger saw
all at once four kindling eyes fastened upon him.</p>

<p>“May I not ask if you have wine in the house,
padrona?” he now repeated. Before the last word was
finished, the dog, howling loudly, sprang upon him
with unaccountable fury and with his teeth tore the
cloak from the man’s shoulders, and would have broken
loose upon him again and again had not a sharp command
from his mistress restrained him.</p>

<p>“Back, Fuoco, back! Peace, be quiet!” The dog
stood in the middle of the room, beating heavily with
his tail, his eyes fixed on the stranger. “Shut him up
in the stall, Pietro!” said the young woman, half-aloud.
She stood at the hearth, rigid as always, and,
as Pietro hesitated, repeated the order. For the nightly
place of the old dog had been for years by the hearth.
The servants whispered one to the other, the dog followed
reluctantly, and from without the howling and
whining penetrated unpleasantly into the room until
it seemed to cease from sheer exhaustion. In the mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</span>
time the maid-servant, at a sign from her mistress, had
brought wine. The stranger drank, handed the beaker
to his companion, and fell into silent reflection over the
surprising disturbance he had so unwittingly caused.
One after the other the servants put down their spoons
and passed out with a “good night, padrona!” At last
the three were alone with their hostess and the old
serving-maid.</p>

<p>“The sun rises at four o’clock,” said one of the contrabbandieri
to the stranger. “Excellency, it is not
necessary to start much earlier to be at Pistoja in good
time. It’s on account of the horse, that must have his
six hours’ rest.”</p>

<p>“Very good, my friend. Go and sleep!”</p>

<p>“We will awaken you, Excellency.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” replied the stranger. “Though
Madonna knows, I do not often sleep six hours at a
stretch. Good night, Carlone; good night, Master
Giuseppe!”</p>

<p>The men removed their hats respectfully and stood
up. One went to the hearth and said: “Padrona, I
have a message from Costanzo from Bologna, who
wants to know if it was at your house he left his knife
lying last Saturday.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said sharply and impatiently.</p>

<p>“I told him you would have sent it back to him long
ago if it had been there. And then—”</p>

<p>“Nina,” she broke in, “show them the way to the
lean-to if they have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>The maid-servant rose. “I was only going to say,
Padrona,” continued the man calmly, with a quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</span>
twinkle in his eyes, “that this gentleman here would
not look twice at his money if you gave him a softer
bed than ours. That is what I wanted to tell you,
Padrona, and now may the Blessed Virgin send you a
good night, Signora Fenice!”</p>

<p>With that he turned to his companion, and, like
him, bowed low before the picture in the corner, crossed
himself, and with the serving-maid both left the room.
“Good night, Nina!” called the young girl. The old
woman turned at the threshold, made a sign of inquiry,
then closed the door behind her quickly and
obediently. Scarcely were they alone, when Fenice
took up the brass lamp that stood at the side of the
hearth and quickly lighted it. The fire was gradually
dying out in the hearth; the three tiny, red flames of
the lamp lighted only one small corner of the room.
The darkness seemed to have made the stranger
drowsy, for he was sitting at the table, his head lying
on his arms, his cloak wrapped close about him, as if
he intended to pass the night that way. Then he
heard his name called; he looked up. The lamp was
burning on the table before him; opposite stood the
young padrona who had called him. With irresistible
power her look drew his toward her. “Filippo,” said
she, “don’t you know me any more?” For a long time
he looked searchingly into the beautiful face which
was all aglow in the light of the lamp, and still more
so from anxiety. The long, yielding eyelashes, as they
slowly lifted and fell, softened the severity of the forehead
and of the slenderly formed nose. Her mouth
was a bloom of the rosiest youth; only, when it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_746">[Pg 746]</span>
silent it had a touch of resignation, sorrow, and wildness,
which the dark eyes did not contradict.</p>

<p>And now, as she stood at the table, the stern beauty
of her figure showed itself, especially the superb lines
of her neck and throat. Nevertheless, after a minute’s
thought, Filippo said:</p>

<p>“Truly, I do not know you, Padrona.”</p>

<p>“It is not possible,” she said, in a strange, deep tone
of assurance. “You have had seven years to be thinking
about me. It is a long time—surely long enough
for the picture to have made an impression.”</p>

<p>This unlooked-for reply seemed all at once to break
the spell of his preoccupation. “Of course, my girl,”
said he, “who thinks for seven years of nothing else
save the beautiful head of a young woman must come
at last to know it by heart.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said she with meaning, “it is quite true, you
said so then, that you would think of nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Seven years ago? Seven years ago I was a light-hearted,
joking fellow. And you believed that in good
faith?”</p>

<p>She nodded three times, earnestly. “Why should I
not believe it? Indeed, I have even learnt it through
my own experience that you said right.”</p>

<p>“Child,” said he with a relenting look that well became
his determined features, “I am sorry. Seven
years ago, very likely, I still thought all women knew
that the tender words of men were worth little more
than the counters which we occasionally exchange for
ringing gold, a matter of course that has been expressly
agreed upon beforehand. What did I not think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_747">[Pg 747]</span>
of you women seven years ago! Now, truly, I seldom
think of you at all. Dear child, there are things so
much more important to think about.”</p>

<p>She was silent, as if she understood nothing of all
this and was willing to wait quietly until he said something
that really concerned her.</p>

<p>“It is surely beginning to dawn upon me,” he said
after a moment’s thought, “that I have traveled over
this part of the mountain before. Perhaps I should
have recognized this village and this house if it had
not been for the mist. Yes, yes, it is the place in the
mountains, of course, where the doctor sent me seven
years ago, and where I stormed up and down the most
inaccessible places, like a fool.”</p>

<p>“I was sure of it,” she said, and a little ray of joy
lighted on her lips. “I was sure you could not have
forgotten. The dog, Fuoco, certainly did not forget
it, neither his old hate of you—nor I—my old love.”
She said this so cheerfully and with such assurance that
he looked at her with increasing surprise.</p>

<p>“I do seem to remember now a young girl,” said he,
“whom I met once on a height of the Apennines, and
who guided me to the home of her parents. I should
otherwise have been obliged to pass the night on the
cliffs. I even remember that I was pleased—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she broke in, “very much!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t please the maiden. I had a long conversation
with her, to which she contributed not above
ten words. When I thought at last to awaken the
sleeping, sullen, sad little mouth with a kiss—I see her
now as she sprang away from me to one side and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</span>
picked up a stone in each hand, so that I hardly came
off without being well stoned. If <em>you</em> are the maiden,
how is it that you now talk to me about your old love?”</p>

<p>“I was fifteen years of age, Filippo, and very shy.
I was always defiant and solitary, and did not know
how to express myself. And then, too, I was afraid
of my parents, who were still living at that time, as
you afterward came to know. My father controlled
many herds and herdsmen, and this inn here. There
has been little change since then. Only he orders and
scolds here no more—may his soul rest in Paradise!
And before my mother I was shyest of all. Do you
not know, you were sitting then at this very spot and
praised the wine we had brought from Pistoja? I
heard no more than this. My mother was looking
sharply at me, so I went out and placed myself behind
the window so that I could still look at you. You were
younger, of course, but not better looking. You have
to-day the same eyes with which you used to conquer
when you wished, and the same mysterious voice which
so aroused the jealousy of the dog, poor beast! Till
then I had loved no one but him! He knew it, that
I loved you more, he knew it better than you did.”</p>

<p>“He was like a mad dog that night, and justly,”
said Filippo. “A wonderful night! But you had seriously
bewitched me, Fenice. I know that I had no rest
when you were unwilling to return to the house again,
that I started up and went out to look for you. I
caught one glimpse of the little white kerchief you
wore on your head, and then no more of you, for you
sprang into the room next to the stable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</span></p>

<p>“That was my bedroom, Filippo. You did not dare
to go in there.”</p>

<p>“But I was going to. I still remember how long I
stood and knocked and begged, bad fellow that I was,
and thought that I should lose my head if I could not
see you once more.”</p>

<p>“Your head? No, your heart, you said. I remember
all the circumstances, the words, everything!”</p>

<p>“Yet you wished to know nothing of them then.”</p>

<p>“I was in a mood to die. I stood in the farthest
corner and thought that if only I could still the beating
of my heart, creep to the door, put my mouth to
the crack through which you were speaking, I could
feel your breath.”</p>

<p>“Foolish, doting time of youth! If your mother
had not come I might have been standing there still;
for in the mean time you might have opened the door.
I am almost ashamed, even now, to think how I went
away in vexation and fury, and had a long dream
about you all that night.”</p>

<p>“I sat up in the dark and watched,” said she.
“Toward morning I fell asleep, and when I awoke
and saw the sun—where were you? No one spoke
of it to me, and I dared not ask. To see a human
face was hateful to me, just as if they had killed you
so that I should not see you any more. Out I rushed,
running and then stopping still, up and down the mountain,
all the time calling for you, cursing you, for because
of you I could now love no more. At last I
came down into the valley; then I got frightened and
turned back again. I had been away two days when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_750">[Pg 750]</span>
I got home. My father beat me and my mother would
not speak to me. They knew very well why I had run
away. And the dog went with me, good Fuoco; but
when I shouted your name out into the stillness, he
growled.”</p>

<p>There followed a pause, while the eyes of the two
rested on each other. Then Filippo spoke: “How long
have your parents been dead?”</p>

<p>“Three years. They died that same week—may
their souls rest in Paradise! Then I went to Florence.”</p>

<p>“To Florence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you said you were going to Florence. The
wife of the café-keeper outside the walls over there by
the side of San Miniato, to her some of the smugglers
directed me. For one month I lived there, and every
day they sent into the city to make inquiries about you.
In the evenings I went down there myself and looked
for you. At last we heard that you had gone long
since—no one quite knew whither.”</p>

<p>Filippo stood up and restlessly paced the room.
Fenice turned toward him, her eyes followed him,
yet she showed no sign of agitation, such as now
moved him. Finally he came up to her, looked at her
a moment, and then said:</p>

<p>“And to what purpose do you confess all this to
me, poveretta?”</p>

<p>“I have been seven years getting my courage together.
Oh! if I had only confessed to you then, it
would not have caused me so much sorrow, this cowardly
heart. But I knew that you must come back,
Filippo; only that it would last for such a long time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_751">[Pg 751]</span>
that I did not know—that made me sad. I am a child
to speak so. Why trouble myself about what is past?
Filippo, you are there, and I am here and yours always,
always!”</p>

<p>“Dear child,” he began softly, and then silenced
what was on the tip of his tongue. But she did not
perceive how quietly and thoughtfully he was standing
before her, staring vacantly beyond her toward the
wall. She continued speaking calmly; it was as if the
words had long become familiar to her, as if she had
imagined them a thousand times in her loneliness: He
will come and thus and so will you speak to him.</p>

<p>“I had many an opportunity to marry up here, and
while I was at Florence. I wanted you only. When
they implored me and spoke honeyed words to me,
your voice sounded out of that far-away night, your
speeches that were sweeter than all other words in the
world. For several years now they have been leaving
me in peace, although I am not old yet, and am still
as—fair as ever I was. It was as if they all knew
you were coming back soon.” Then again: “Where
are you going to take me now? Will you remain up
here? No, for you, that will never do. Since I was
in Florence I have learned that life in the mountains
is dreary. We will sell the house and the herds, then
I shall be rich. I am tired of the wild life of these
people up here. In Florence they had to teach me all
a young city woman should know, and they were astonished
how quickly I learned everything. Truly I had
little time to spare, and all my dreams kept telling me
that it would be up here where you would seek me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">[Pg 752]</span>
again. I inquired, too, of a fortune-teller, and it has
all turned out just as she said.”</p>

<p>“And if I already have a wife?”</p>

<p>She looked straight at him from her full height.
“You are only wishing to prove me, Filippo! You
have no wife. That, too, the fortune-teller told me.
But where you lived, that she did not know.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Fenice, I have no wife. But whence
does she know, or you, that I shall ever be willing to
take one?”</p>

<p>“How could you <em>not</em> wish for me?” said she with
unshaken confidence.</p>

<p>“Sit down here by me, Fenice! I have much to tell
you. Give me your hand; promise that you will hear
me patiently to the end, my poor little friend!” As
she did none of all these things, he continued with a
quickening pulse, standing in front of her, his eyes
resting sadly upon her, while her own, as if foreboding
something that would threaten her very life, now
closed and now strayed to the ground.</p>

<p>“For years I have been compelled to keep away from
Florence,” he began. “As you know, there were at
that time those political uprisings, that kept wavering
so long, this way and that. I am a lawyer, and so
know hosts of people, and write and receive a great
number of letters throughout the year. Added to this,
I was an independent, spoke my mind when it was necessary
and was heartily hated, although I never wished
to thrust any hand of mine into their secret game.
Finally it became necessary for me to fly if I wished
to escape an endless trial and imprisonment that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</span>
be neither for profit nor purpose. I went to Bologna,
practised law for a living, and saw few people, women
least of all; for of the gay young fellow for whom
you have been wearing your heart out for seven years,
there is nothing left, except that my head, or my heart,
if you will, is still ready to burst if I can not be conquering
something—in these days to be sure something
other than the bolt of a pretty girl’s bedroom door.
You have heard, perhaps, how at the last there was
also a disturbance at Bologna. They had arrested certain
highly respected men, among them one whose way
of living I had known for a long time, and knew, too,
that his spirit was far from these matters. After that
a miserable government undertook to reform matters,
much as if a sickness had broken out among your sheep
and you sent a wolf into the fold. But that is neither
here nor there. Enough that my friend begged me to
plead his cause for him, and that I helped him to gain
his freedom. No sooner had this become known, when
one day a wretched fellow came running up to me on
the street and covered me with insults. I could not
get rid of him except by thrusting him aside with my
arm against his chest, for he was intoxicated. Scarcely
had I found myself out of the crowd and had stepped
into a café, when there came toward me a relative of
this man, also intoxicated, not with wine but with
venom and anger, and upbraided me as if I had been
guilty of answering words with blows, instead of doing
what every man of honor would have done. I answered
as calmly as I could, for I now perceived that
the whole affair was a preconcerted plan of the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</span>
to force me shamelessly into a duel. So one
word led to another until my enemy at last won his
game. He pretended that he was obliged to go into
Tuscany, and insisted that the affair should be settled
over there. I agreed, for it was time that one of us
calm members should prove to the hot-heads that the
cause of our restraint was not lack of spirit, but simply
the hopelessness of all private intrigue when opposed
to such superior power. But when, the day before
yesterday, I applied for a passport, it was refused me—unless
I were willing to give my reasons; these were
the orders of the supreme authority, so they said. It
was now clear to me that they wanted either to draw
me into disgrace by causing me to miss the duel, or
to force me to steal over the border in some sort of
disguise, where I could safely be caught in ambush.
Then they would have pretext enough to bring legal
action against me and to prolong the trial to suit their
convenience.”</p>

<p>“The wretches! The God-forsaken!” broke in the
young girl, and clenched her hands.</p>

<p>“So nothing remained but to trust myself to the contrabbandieri
in Poretta. Early in the morning, so
they tell me, we can reach Pistoja. The duel is arranged
for the afternoon, in a garden just outside of
the town.”</p>

<p>Impetuously she grasped his hand in both of hers.
“Do not go down there, Filippo,” she said. “They
will murder you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, that is what they want, child, nothing
less. But how do you know it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_755">[Pg 755]</span></p>

<p>“I know it here and—here!” and with her finger she
touched her forehead and her heart.</p>

<p>“You also are a witch, a soothsayer,” he continued,
laughing. “Yes, I think they do wish to murder me.
My adversary is the best shot in Tuscany. They have
done me the honor to oppose to me a distinguished foe.
Now I, too, will not altogether disgrace myself. Yet
who knows how regular the proceedings will be?
Who can tell? Or perhaps you have magic enough
to prophesy that too? But what good would it do,
child? It could not alter facts.”</p>

<p>“Now you must drive it out of your mind,” he continued
after a short silence, “this following the bent
of your foolish old love. Perhaps everything has had
to turn out so, that I might not leave the world until
I had set you free, free from yourself and your unhappy
loyalty, poor child. Think, we may have been
poorly suited to one another. Your loyalty was given
to another Filippo, a young coxcomb with giddy lips,
and carefree except for love. What would you have
done with a melancholy brooder, a hermit?” During
the last half of the sentence he spoke to himself, pacing
up and down, but now he went up to her, and as he
was about to seize her by the hand he stopped, shocked
by the expression of her face. All the gentleness had
gone from her manner, all the color from her lips.</p>

<p>“You do not love me!” she said, slowly and dully,
as if another spirit were speaking out of her, as if she
were listening to her own words in order to learn what
was really meant. Then she drew back her hand with
a cry, so that the tiny flames in the lamp threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_756">[Pg 756]</span>
to go out. And from without the ear was suddenly
chilled by an angry whine and howl from the dog.</p>

<p>“You do not love me, no, no!” she cried, as if beside
herself. “Can you give yourself over to death
rather than into my arms? Can you speak calmly of
your death as if it were not mine, too? It were better
for me if these eyes were blind rather than see you
again, and these ears had become dumb before they
were forced to hear the cruel voice by which I live
and die. Why did the dog not tear you to pieces before
I knew that you had come? Why did your foot
not slip on the edge of the precipice? Alas! Alas!
Behold my sorrow, O Madonna!”</p>

<p>She flung herself before the picture, lay with her
forehead to the ground, her hands spread far from
her, and seemed to pray.</p>

<p>Between the murmurs and groans of the unhappy
girl the man heard the alarm of the dog, while the
moon now gained its full power and illuminated the
whole room. And now before he could collect himself
or speak a word he felt her arms about his neck
again, her mouth on his throat and hot tears falling
over his face.</p>

<p>“Do not go to your death, Filippo!” sobbed the poor
girl. “If you stay here with me, who will ever find
you? Let them talk as they will, the crowd of murderers,
the cowardly wretches, more detestable than
the wolves of the Apennines! Yes,” she said, and
looked up at him through her streaming tears, “you
will stay. The Madonna has sent you to me—that I
might save you. Filippo, I do not know what angry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_757">[Pg 757]</span>
words I spoke, but that they were angry I felt by the
icy contraction here at my heart from which the words
relieved me. Forgive me for that. It puts me in hell
to think that love can be forgotten and loyalty trodden
under foot. Let us sit down here and consider the
matter. Do you wish a new house? We will build
one. A change of company? We will send every one
away, even Nina, even the old dog shall go. And if
you think then they may betray you—why we will go
ourselves, even to-day, now. I know all the paths, and
before the sun rises we will be deep among the ravines
on our way toward the north, and wandering, wandering
to Genoa, to Venice, wherever you will.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” said he sternly. “It is enough folly. You
can not be my wife, Fenice. Even if they do not kill
me to-morrow, it will not be for long, for I know how
I am in their toils.” Quietly but firmly he released
his neck from her arms.</p>

<p>“See! my child,” he continued, “things are unhappy
enough as they stand, and we ought not to make them
worse through want of reason. Perhaps when you
hear of my death later, your eyes will be resting on
a husband and beautiful children, and you will be
thankful the dead man of this night had more wisdom
than you, even as in that other night you had more
wisdom than he. Let me go to rest now. Go you,
too, and take care we do not see each other again in
the morning. You have a good reputation, as I learnt
from my contrabbandieri on the way here. Should we
see each other in the morning, and should you make a
scene—you understand, my child? And now, good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</span>
night, good night, Fenice!” Then once more he
begged her earnestly for her hand. But she did not
give it to him. She looked absolutely white in the
moonlight; her brows and lowered eyelashes all the
darker.</p>

<p>“Have I not sufficiently atoned for having enjoyed
seven years ago one long night of too much happiness?
And now he wills that this thousand-times accursed
happiness shall make me unhappy again, and this time
for the length of an eternity? No, no, no! I will
never let him go! I would dishonor myself before all
men if he should go away and die.”</p>

<p>“Did you not hear,” he broke in sharply, “that it is
my will to rest? Why do you talk with such infatuation,
making yourself ill? If you can not feel that
honor must tear me from you, then you can never be
fit for me. I am no doll on your lap to be fondled and
joked with. My paths I have marked out before me,
and they are too narrow for two. Show me the hide
on which I am to pass the night and then—let us
forget each other!”</p>

<p>“Though you drive me from you with blows, I will
not leave you! If death places himself between us,
with these good arms I will save you from him. In
death and life—you are mine, Filippo!”</p>

<p>“Be still!” he cried aloud. The color rose suddenly
to his forehead, as with both arms he pushed the impetuous
figure from him. “Be still! And now it is
over—now and forever. Am I a <em>thing</em> that can be
dragged to any one that calls for it—to any one whose
eyes take a fancy to it? You have been sighing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_759">[Pg 759]</span>
me for seven years—does that give you the right to
make me untrue to myself in the eighth? If you
wished to corrupt me, your method was badly chosen.
Seven years ago I loved you because you were different
from what you are to-day. If you had flown to my
neck then, and had hoped to win my heart by boldness,
I would have set boldness against boldness, as
I do to-day! Now, all is over between us, and I know
that the pity that moved me before was not love. For
the last time, where is my room?”</p>

<p>Sharply and coldly he said this, and in the silence
that followed he felt pain at the tone of his own voice.
Yet he added not a word, wondering in the stillness
that she took it so much more calmly than he had
feared. Far rather would he now have soothed some
stormy outburst of her sorrow with kinder words. But
she went past him coldly, threw open a heavy wooden
door not far from the hearth, in silence pointed to the
iron bolt, and then returned to the hearth again.</p>

<p>He entered and bolted the door behind him. Yet
for a moment he stood standing by the door, to listen
to what she might be doing. But there was not a
sound of life in the room and not a stir could be heard
in the whole house save the restlessness of the dog, the
pawing of the horses in their stalls, and the whistling
of the wind without which was fast driving away the
last streaks of the mist. The moon in all its glory
was now shining in the heavens, and it flooded the
room as Filippo drew a great bunch of heather out of
a hole in the wall which served as a window. He now
plainly saw he was in Fenice’s room. There against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</span>
the wall stood her neat, narrow bed, near it a chest
unlocked, a small table, a little wooden bench, the walls
hung with pictures of saints and madonnas, a little
bowl of holy water under the crucifix by the door.</p>

<p>He now threw himself on the hard bed and felt the
storm raging within him. A few minutes, and he
raised one foot about to hasten out and tell her that
he had hurt her only that he might heal her; then he
stamped on the ground, vexed at such effeminate weakness.
“It is the one thing that remains,” he said to
himself, “if crimes and misfortunes are to increase no
more. Seven years, poor child!” A heavy comb,
decorated with little pieces of metal, lay on a small
table; he took it up mechanically in his hand. This
brought to mind again the abundance of her hair, the
proud neck on which it rested, the noble forehead
round which it curled, and the browned cheeks. Then
he threw the tempter into the trunk, where he saw the
neat dresses, kerchiefs for the head, and bits of finery
of all sorts, folded together carefully and in order.
Slowly he let the lid fall again, and then went to the
hole in the wall and looked out.</p>

<p>The room lay in the rear of the house, so that none
of the other huts of Treppi obstructed his view over
the chasm-cleft highlands. Opposite, stretching behind
the ravine, was the naked ridge of rocks, bathed
in the moon that must now be standing directly over
the house. At one side he saw a few sheds, past
which a path ran down into the abyss. A forlorn little
pine tree, with bare twigs, was trying to take root
among the stones; besides this only heather covered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</span>
ground, with here and there some pitiable little bush.
“Surely,” said he in the stillness, “this is not a place
in which to forget what one has loved. I would it
were otherwise! Yes, yes, she who has loved me more
than finery and flirting and the whispering of cox-combs
would be the right wife for me, after all. What
eyes would my old Marco make if he saw me suddenly
return from my journey with a beautiful wife. Not
once would we need to change our abode; and how
unhomelike are the innumerable corners of solitude!
And it would be good for me, at times—an old grumbler,
a laughing child—but folly, folly, Filippo! What
would the poor thing do as a widow in Bologna! No,
no, none of that! No new sins added to the old mass!
I will rise an hour before the others, and steal out and
away before a soul in Treppi awakes.”</p>

<p>He was about to turn from the window to stretch his
form on the bed, worn out from the long ride, when
he saw a womanly figure move out from the shadow
of the house into the moonlight. She did not look
round, but in his mind there was no doubt that it was
Fenice. With quiet steps and long, she turned from
the house in the direction of the path that led down
into the ravine. A shudder crept over him, for at the
same moment the suspicion entered his mind that she
intended to harm herself. Without a moment’s thought
he sprang to the door and tore violently at the bolt.
But the old rusty iron had imbedded itself so stubbornly
in the clamps that in vain he used every effort.
A cold sweat stood on his brow; he shouted, shook,
and pounded against the door with fists and feet, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</span>
could not force it. At length he gave over and rushed
back to the window hole. The stone was already yielding
to his fury when suddenly he saw again the figure
of the young girl rise on the path and wind its way
toward the hut. She was carrying something in her
hand, which by the uncertain light he could not make
out, only her face he saw distinctly; it was earnest and
thoughtful, but without passion. Not a look did she
cast toward his window, and again she disappeared
into shadow, while he stood there, breathing heavily
from anxiety and exertion. He heard a distinct noise,
which seemed to come from the direction of the old
dog, but it was neither bark nor whine. The mystery
oppressed him uncomfortably. He leaned his head far
out of the opening, but nothing was he conscious of
save the still night in the mountains. All at once
sounded a short, sharp cry, followed by the heart-rending
moan of the dog, and then long and anxiously
he listened; not another sound the whole night long,
save once when the door of the neighboring chamber
slammed and Fenice’s step could be heard on the stone
floor. In vain he stood for long at the bolted door,
listening, questioning, imploring the girl for one short
word. All was quiet next to him. He now threw himself
on the bed, as in a fever, and lay there watching
and thinking, until at last a few hours before midnight
the moon sank and weariness became lord of his thousand
fluctuating thoughts. As sleep left him, a twilight
surrounded Filippo; yet when his mind was fully
awake and he had raised himself in bed, he became
aware that it was not like the twilight that comes before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_763">[Pg 763]</span>
sunrise. From one side there stole toward him a
feeble ray of sunlight, and he soon noticed that the hole
in the wall which he had left open before he went to
sleep had now become stuffed with brushwood. He
pulled it out and the full morning sun blinded him.
In highest wrath at the contrabbandieri, his sleep, and
most of all at the young girl to whom he attributed
this piece of trickery, he went instantly to the door,
whose bolt now easily gave way to a moderate push,
and entered the neighboring room.</p>

<p>He met Fenice alone, left sitting at the hearth as if
she had been long expecting him. From her face had
vanished every trace of yesterday’s storm, not one motion
of the sorrow, not so much as a line of her violent
self-control met his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“You have managed well that I should sleep away
the hours,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, indifferently. “You were tired out.
You will arrive in Pistoja early enough, if you do not
have to meet the murderers until the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I did not ask you to concern yourself about my
weariness. Are you still going to force yourself upon
me? It will do you no good, girl. Where are my
men?”</p>

<p>“Gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone? Do you intend to make a fool of me?
Where are they? Silly woman, as if they would go
without being paid!” And he strode hastily toward
the door, about to go out.</p>

<p>But Fenice remained sitting motionless, and kept
speaking in the same even tone: “I have paid them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</span>
I told them that you needed sleep and that I would
accompany you down there myself; it happens that the
supply of wine has given out and I must buy new, an
hour this side of Pistoja.”</p>

<p>For a moment anger prevented him from speaking.
“No!” he broke out at last, “not with you, never with
you! Treacherous serpent! It is laughable that you
still think to ensnare me in your slippery coils. We
are now as completely separated as ever. I despise you
that you hold me weak and pitiable enough to be won
over by these little artifices. I will not go with you!
Let me have one of your servants and then—pay yourself
for the price of the contrabbandieri.”</p>

<p>He threw a purse to her, and opened the door to
search for some one who might conduct him down
the mountain. “Put yourself to no trouble,” said
she, “you will find none of the servants; they are all
away in the mountains. And, besides, there is no one
in Treppi who could serve you. Poor, feeble, old
women, old men and children, they are still in their
huts. If you do not believe me—look!</p>

<p>“And apart from all else,” she continued, as he
stood at the threshold irresolute, in fury and vexation,
and turned his back on her. “Why, think you, is the
way so impossible and dangerous if I guide you? I
had a dream last night by which I see that you are not
intended for me. It is true, I shall still always like
you a little, and it will give me pleasure still to chat
with you for a few hours. Must I, for that reason,
be laying snares for you? You are free to go from
me wherever you will, to death or to life. Only, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</span>
would go along with you a little way. I will swear
to you, if that will appease you, that it will be for
only a short way—by my life, not so far as Pistoja.
Only so far until you have struck the right path. For
if you go off on your own account you will soon lose
your way, so that you can go neither forward nor back.
You ought to know that, indeed, from your former
tramps over the mountain.”</p>

<p>“Pest!” he murmured, and bit his lip. But he saw
that the sun was rising, and after all, perhaps, what
serious grounds had he for anxiety? He turned about
and looked at her, and believed that he could trust the
evidence of the clear-tempered look in her great eyes,
that no kind of treachery lurked behind her words.
She seemed to him to have become altogether another
person since yesterday, and he had to confess that there
was a feeling of uneasiness, mingled with his surprise,
that yesterday’s attack of violent passion had passed
over so soon and without leaving a trace. He looked
at her a while longer, but she gave cause for no suspicion
whatever.</p>

<p>“If you have grown reasonable, then,” he said, “let
it be so. Come!”</p>

<p>Without any special sign of pleasure, she rose and
said: “We must eat first; we will not find anything on
the way.” She set a plate before him and a jug, and
then she herself began to eat, standing by the hearth,
but of wine she drank not a drop. He, on the contrary,
to make a quick end of the matter, ate a few
spoonfuls, gulped down the wine, and lighted his cigar
at the coals on the hearth. During all this time not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">[Pg 766]</span>
look had he vouchsafed in her direction, but he saw
as he looked at her by chance, for she was standing
near him, that there was a bright spot on each of her
cheeks and something like triumph in her eyes. She
rose impetuously, seized the jug, and at one fling shattered
it on the stone floor.</p>

<p>“No one else shall drink out of this,” said she,
“since your lips have hung upon it.”</p>

<p>He started up in surprise; for a moment the suspicion
crossed his mind: “Has she given me poison?”
But immediately he preferred to believe that it was
only the dying flame left of the love-worship she had
forsworn, and without further ado he followed her
out of the house.</p>

<p>“They have taken the horse on with them to
Poretta,” she remarked, for by his eyes he seemed
to be looking for the animal. “You could not have
ridden away, either, without danger. The roads are
steeper than yesterday.”</p>

<p>She now went on before him, and soon they left
behind them the huts that stood out in the sharp sun,
lifeless and without the tiniest cloud of smoke issuing
from the chimneys.</p>

<p>Now for the first time Filippo noticed the perfect
majesty of the wilderness, over which was hanging
a clear, transparent sky. Their way, scarcely discernible
by the somewhat obscured traces over the
hard rocks, lay northward along a wide ridge, and
now and then, where the line of the parallel ridge
opposite curved downward, a strip of sea gleamed
along the horizon on the left. Far and wide was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_767">[Pg 767]</span>
no vegetation save the dwarfed mountain shrubs and
the lichens. But now they left the heights and descended
into the ravine which had to be crossed in
order to mount to the opposite ridge. Here they soon
came upon the pines and oaks that sprung up in the
ravine, and heard the rushing of the waters far below.
Fenice was now walking ahead, stepping with sure
foot over the firmest stones, without looking about
or speaking a word. He could not help but let his
eyes hang upon her and admire the supple power of
her limbs. Her great white headkerchief wholly concealed
her face from him, but whenever it became
necessary for them to walk together side by side, he
was compelled to look about him and away from her,
so forcibly did the features of the noble scene attract
him. Now, in the full sunlight, he noticed for the
first time her peculiar childlike expression, without
being able to say in what it particularly lay, as if,
perhaps, there still remained something of seven years
ago in her face, while everything else had been developing.</p>

<p>At last he began to speak of herself, and she gave
him frank, reasonable answers. Only that her voice,
which was ordinarily not hard and hollow, as is usually
the case with women reared in the mountains,
to-day was monotonous and sounded most melancholy
over things of least account. These paths over which
they were traveling had of late years been very generally
frequented by political fugitives, most of whom
had, of course, rested at Treppi on the way. Filippo
inquired of the girl about them and certain others of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</span>
his acquaintance whom he described; but few of them
could she call to mind, although she was aware that
the smugglers had allowed many a stranger to pass
the night at her house. Of one of these she had only
too vivid a recollection. At the description of him
the blood mounted to her face and she stood still.</p>

<p>“He is a bad one!” she said sullenly. “That night
I woke the servants and had him locked out of the
house.”</p>

<p>During this talk the lawyer did not notice how high
the sun was rising and that not a glimpse of the Tuscan
plain had yet appeared. He was thinking, too, in
a disconnected way, of the approaching end of the
day. It was so refreshing to be tramping along this
path, overgrown with bushes, fifty feet above the torrent,
to feel the fine spray of the waterfall dash up
against his face, to see the lizards slipping over the
stones, and the graceful butterflies chasing the furtive
sunlight, that he was not once conscious of how they
were wandering up-stream and not yet turning westward
at all. There was a magic in the voice of his
guide that made him forget everything that had yesterday,
in the company of the smugglers, been so incessantly
in his mind. But now, as they ascended out of
the ravine, and the boundless, utterly strange mountain
wastes, with new heights and cliffs, desolate and
parched, lay before them, he awoke all at once from
his day-dream, stood still and looked into the sky.
He now understood clearly that they had been wandering
in the opposite direction, and quite two hours
farther away from his goal than when they set out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</span></p>

<p>“Halt!” said Filippo. “I see in time that you have
betrayed me after all. Is that the way to Pistoja, you
traitress?”</p>

<p>“No,” said she, fearlessly, but her eyes fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Now, then, by all the power of hell, the devil can
easily take lessons and learn hypocrisy of you. A
curse on my blindness!”</p>

<p>“Man is all-powerful, man is mightier than the
devil and the angels, if he loves,” she said in a deep,
melancholy tone.</p>

<p>“No,” he cried, in a flash of sudden fury, “you have
not triumphed yet. Do not exult yet, overconfident
girl, not yet! What a crazy girl calls love can not
break the will of a man. Turn back with me to the
place and show me the shortest way—or I will choke
you with these hands—you fool, who can not see I
must hate you, you who are willing to make me appear
before all the world as a good-for-nothing.” He
stepped up close in front of her, with clenched hands;
he completely forgot himself.</p>

<p>“Ah! Do choke me!” She spoke with a loud but
trembling voice. “Only do it, Filippo! But when
you have done it, you will throw yourself over my
body and weep blood from your eyes, that you can not
bring me to life again. Your place will be here by
me, you will struggle with the vultures that try to tear
my flesh to pieces; the sun will scorch you by day, the
dew of night will wet you, until you rot away as I do—but
to leave me you are utterly incapable. Do you
think a poor foolish thing that has been brought up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_770">[Pg 770]</span>
among the mountains will throw away seven years
as easily as she does a day? I know what those years
have cost me, how dear they were, and that I am paying
a good round price when I wish to buy you with
them. Should I let you go to your death? The idea
is one to be laughed at. Once turn away from me and
you will soon be aware that I am drawing you back
to me forever. For in the wine that you drank to-day
there was mixed a love-charm which no man under
the sun has ever yet withstood.”</p>

<p>Royal she looked as she cried out these words, her
arms stretched toward him as if her hand were holding
out a sceptre to one that owed her allegiance. But
he laughed at it and said: “Your love-charm has rendered
you poor service, for I never hated you more
than I do at this moment. But I am a fool to hate
a fool. May you be cured as well of your love as of
your superstition, when you see me no more. I do
not need your guidance. I see over on yonder slope
a shepherd’s hut with the herd about it. There’s a
fire gleaming. There they will undoubtedly put me in
the right way. Farewell, poor serpent, farewell!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She answered nothing as he went away, and sat
down quietly in the ravine, in the shadow of a rock,
in the gloomy green of the fir trees that grew down
by the stream, her great eyes lowered to the ground.
He had not gone long from her before he found himself
without a path, between cliffs and bushes; then,
much as he might like to deny it, the words of this
strange girl kept exercising on his heart a disturbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_771">[Pg 771]</span>
influence that turned his thoughts all inward. Meanwhile
he kept ever in view the heath-fire in the meadow
opposite, working his way through to reach the valley.
By the position of the sun he reckoned that it must now
be about the tenth hour. But when he had climbed down
the mountain steep he found a sunless path beneath,
and soon after a narrow bridge that crossed a new
mountain stream and led up along the opposite side,
and promised to open out into the meadow. He followed
this, and at first the path ran steep up, but afterward,
by a great circuit, far away to the foot of the
mountain. He saw now that this would not bring
him straight to his goal; yet over the more direct way
hung inaccessible, precipitous crags, and unless he preferred
to return, he must trust himself to this path.
Now he walked on briskly, at first like one released
from the fetters over yonder, and peering out intently
every once in a while for the hut that kept continually
receding. By and by, as his blood began to pulse more
evenly, there came into his mind again all the details
of the scene through which he had just passed. The
picture of the beautiful girl he now saw before him
vividly, and not as before, through the mist of sudden
anger. He could not resist a feeling of profound pity.
“She is over there now,” he said to himself. “The
poor, deluded child sits building castles with her magic
art. It was for that she left the hut yesterday at
night, and by the light of the moon to gather who
knows what harmless herbs. I remember; did not
even my own brave smugglers, too, point out to me
some special white blossoms among the rocks, and say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_772">[Pg 772]</span>
they were powerful in exciting love for love? Innocent
flowers, how they have slandered you! And it
was for that she shattered the jug, for that the wine
tasted so bitter on my tongue. The older innocence
grows, the stronger and more worthy of honor it becomes.
How like the Cumæan Sibyl she stood before
me, so truth-compelling, almost like that Roman as
she flung her books into the fire. How beautiful and
afflicted your delusions have made you!”</p>

<p>The farther he went, the stronger did he feel the
pathetic splendor of her love and the power of her
beauty which separation was now beginning to make
clear to him.</p>

<p>“I ought not to have made her suffer because
she wished in perfect good faith to save me, to set
me free from my inevitable duties. I should have
taken the hand she offered me and said: ‘I love
you, Fenice, and if I am still alive, I will come back
to you and take you home.’ How blind I was not to
have thought of this way out! Shame upon the lawyer!
I ought to have taken leave of her with kisses,
like a bridegroom, then she would have had no suspicion
that I was deceiving her, instead of which I
have insisted with the stubborn girl and only made
matters worse.”</p>

<p>Now he became absorbed in the dream of such a
leave-taking and fancied he felt her breath and the
touch of her fresh young lips upon his own. It was as
if he almost heard his name called. “Fenice!” he cried
back passionately, and stood still with violently beating
heart. The stream rushed beneath him, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</span>
branches of the firs hung motionless, far and wide a
shady wilderness.</p>

<p>Her name was again upon his lips, when just in
time the shame of what the world thinks sealed his
mouth—shame and a fear as well. He struck himself
upon the brow. “Am I still so far gone that I even
dream of her while I am awake?” he cried. “Is she
to prove right that no man under the sun is able to
withstand this magic? Then, indeed, I should be
worthy of nothing better than what she thought to
make of me, to be called a Squire of Dames all my life
long! No, to hell with you, beautiful, deceiving she-devil!”</p>

<p>He had regained for the moment his self-control,
but now he saw that he had also been led astray from
his path. He could not go back unless he was willing
to run into the arms of danger. So now he concluded
to reach again, at any price, some height from which
he could look about him for the lost shepherd’s hut.
The bank of the stream along which he was walking,
rushing far below, was much too steep. So he flung
his cloak over his shoulder, chose a secure footing, and
at one leap was on the other side of the ravine, whose
walls came close together here. In better spirits, he
now mounted the opposite slope and soon came out
into the broad sunshine. The sun beat on his head
cruelly and his tongue was parched with thirst, as
with a great effort he worked his way up. Now all
at once anxiety came upon him that in spite of all his
pains he might never reach the goal. Thicker and
thicker the blood mounted to his head; he blamed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</span>
devil’s wine that he had tossed down in the morning,
and again he had to think of the white blossoms they
had pointed out to him yesterday on the way. Here
they were growing again—his flesh crept. “If it
should be true,” he thought; “if there are powers that
can master our hearts and minds and bend the will
of a man to the caprice of a maid—rather let the
worst come than this disgrace! Rather death than
slavery. But no, no, no, a lie can conquer only him
who believes in it. Be a man, Filippo; forward, the
height is there before you; only a short time, and
this cursed mountain with its ghosts will lie behind
you forever!”</p>

<p>And yet he could not cool the fever in his blood.
Every stone, every slippery place, every pine-bough
hanging heavily before him was a reminder which he
had to conquer by force, with an exertion of will out
of all proportion. When at last he arrived at the
height, holding on by the last bushes and with a swing
gained the top, the blood was dripping from his eyes
so, and the sudden glare of the sun so dazed him, that
he could not look about. Angrily he chafed his forehead,
and lifting his hat brushed his hand through
the tangled hair. Then again he heard his name
called, this time in very truth, and started terrified
toward the spot from which they were calling him.
And opposite, a few steps from the rock, as he had left
her, sat Fenice, looking at him with calm, happy eyes.</p>

<p>“Have you come at last, Filippo!” she said heartily.
“I expected you sooner.”</p>

<p>“Phantom of Hell!” he cried, beside himself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_775">[Pg 775]</span>
fear, as all the passion of longing struggled within
him, “do you still mock me because I am led astray by
pain and the sun is melting everything in my brain?
Do you triumph because I am forced to see you once
more, in order that I may amuse you once more? If
I have found you again, by God Almighty, it is not
because I have looked for you, and you shall lose me
in spite of it!”</p>

<p>She shook her head, laughing strangely. “It draws
you without your knowing it,” she said. “You would
find me if all the mountains in the world were between
us, for in your wine I mixed seven drops of the dog’s
heart’s blood. Poor Fuoco! He loved me and he
hated you. So the Filippo that you once were you
shall hate as you hated me and shall have no peace
again until you love me. Filippo, do you not see now
that I have conquered you? Come now, I will show
you the way again to Genoa, my beloved, my husband,
my hero!”</p>

<p>With that she stood up, and was about to encircle
him with her two arms, when suddenly she shrank
back from his face. He had become deathly pale, except
for the red in the whites of his eyes, his lips
moved without giving a sound, his hat had fallen
from his head, with his hands he hastily waved off
every approach.</p>

<p>“A dog! a dog!” were his first painfully spoken
words. “No! no! no! You shall not conquer, demon!
Better a dead man than a living dog!” At that rang
out a frightful laugh from his lips, and heavily, as if
he were struggling by force for every step, his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_776">[Pg 776]</span>
fixed staringly at the girl, he turned, staggering, and
fell headlong backward down into the ravine which
he had just left.</p>

<p>Before her eyes it was night; with both hands she
tore at her heart and sent out a cry that rang through
the ravine like the cry of a falcon, as she saw the tall
figure disappear over the edge of the precipice. She
tottered a few steps, then stood firm and upright, her
hands always crushed against her heart. “Madonna!”
she cried, without giving a thought to anything. Always
looking down ahead of her, impetuously she
now approached the ravine and began to climb down
the stone wall between the firs. Her lips, breathing
heavily, murmured words without meaning; with one
hand she gripped fast her heart, with the other she
let herself down by the stones and branches. Thus,
until she came to the base of the fir trees—there he was
lying. He had his eyes closed, his forehead and hair
covered with blood, his back leaning against the trunk
of a tree. His coat was torn and his right leg, moreover,
seemed to be wounded. Whether he lived she
could not make out. She took him up in both arms,
then she felt that he still moved. His cloak, which
he had worn closely about his shoulders, seemed to
have broken the force of his fall. “Christ be praised!”
she said, breathing once more. It was as if the
strength of a giant had come to her, as she climbed
up the steep again with the helpless man against her
breast. It was long work. Four times she laid him
down among the moss and rocks, still the life slept in
him. When at last she arrived at the top with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_777">[Pg 777]</span>
unfortunate burden, her own knees gave way, and she
lay for a moment in a faint and in complete unconsciousness.
Then she stood up and turned away in
the direction in which lay the shepherd’s hut. When
she had come near enough she set up a shrill call
throughout the width of the valley. The echo answered
first, then a human voice. She called a second
time, and then turned back without waiting for the
answer. When she again came to the helpless man,
she moaned sorrowfully and dragged him into the
shadow of the rock where she had been sitting before
and waiting for him. There he found himself when
consciousness feebly returned and he first opened his
eyes again. He saw two shepherds by him, one an old
man, the other a young lad of seventeen years. They
were sprinkling water in his face and rubbing his temples.
His head was resting softly; he did not know
that he was lying in the lap of the young girl.</p>

<p>He seemed altogether to have forgotten her. He
heaved a deep sigh that shook him from head to foot,
and then closed his eyes again. At last he begged
with faltering voice: “One of you good people, will
you go down—quickly—to Pistoja. They are waiting
for me. May God’s mercy reward him who tells the
landlord of the Fortuna—how it is with me. I
mean—” his voice and consciousness failed again.</p>

<p>“I will go,” said the girl. “You two, in the meanwhile,
carry the master to Treppi, and lay him on the
bed which Nina will show you. She must call the
surgeon, the old woman, and have the master healed
and bandaged by her. Lift him up, you, Tommaso,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</span>
by the shoulders; you, Beppo, by the feet. So, lift
him! Softly! Softly! But stop—dip this in water
and lay it on his brow and wet it again at every
spring. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>She tore from her head a great piece of the linen
kerchief, soaked it and bound it about the bloody head
of Filippo. Then he was lifted up, the men bore him
on to Treppi, and the girl, gazing after him with the
life entirely gone from her eyes, picked up her skirts
quickly and went along the rough path down the
mountain.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was about three o’clock in the afternoon when
she reached Pistoja. The Fortuna inn lay some hundred
feet beyond the city, and at this, the hour of
siesta, there was but little sign of life within. In the
shadow of the broad overhanging eaves wagons were
standing, unhitched, while the drivers were asleep on
the cushions; in the great smithy opposite, all work
was at rest, and through the thickly dusted trees along
the highway not a breeze was stirring. Fenice went
over to the spring in front of the house, whose stream,
the only busy thing about, was pouring down into the
great stone trough, and refreshed her hands and face.
Then she drank, slow and deep, to still both thirst and
hunger, and went into the tavern.</p>

<p>The landlord lifted himself sleepily from the bench
in the wine-room, but lay down again when he
saw that it was a girl from Treppi that disturbed
his rest.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he addressed her sharply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_779">[Pg 779]</span>
“If you want something to eat or some wine, go into
the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Are you the landlord?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Who else but me? You know me, I should think—Baldassare
Tizzi of the Fortuna. What have you
got for me, my pretty daughter?”</p>

<p>“A message from Signor Filippo Mannini, the
lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Eh, eh, that’s it, is it? That’s something different,
to be sure,” and he got up quickly. “Didn’t he come
himself, child? There are some gentlemen over there
waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“Then bring me to them.”</p>

<p>“Ei, ei, the sphinx! Can’t a man know what he has
to say to the gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“There, there, very good, child, very good. Every
one has his own secret, this pretty stubborn-head as
well as the tough skull of old Baldassare. Eh, eh, so
he is not coming; that will be very displeasing to the
gentlemen; they appear to have important business
with him.” He became silent and looked at the girl
sidewise. But as she gave no sign of taking him into
her confidence, but opened the door, he put on his
straw hat and went out with her, shaking his head.</p>

<p>A little wine-garden lay at the back of the court
through which she passed as the old man continued
breaking out into questions and exclamations to which
she returned not a word. At the end of the middle
arbor-walk lay an unpretentious summer house; the
shutters were closed, and on the inside over the glass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</span>
door hung down a heavy curtain. A few steps from
the pavilion, the landlord told Fenice to wait—and he
went alone to the door, which opened at his knock.
Fenice then saw the curtain thrust aside and a pair of
eyes look out at her. Then the old man came back to
her and said that the gentlemen would speak with her.</p>

<p>As Fenice entered the pavilion a man who had been
sitting at the table with his back to the door rose and
shot a quick, piercing glance at her. Two others remained
seated on their chairs. On the table she saw
flasks of wine and glasses.</p>

<p>“The signor, the lawyer, is not coming, as he
promised?” said the men before whom she stood.</p>

<p>“Who are you, and what have you brought as evidence
of your mission?”</p>

<p>“I am a girl from Treppi, Fenice Cattaneo, sir.
Evidence? I have none, other than that I am telling
the truth.”</p>

<p>“Why does the signor, the lawyer, not come? We
thought he was a man of honor.”</p>

<p>“He is none the less honorable because he has suffered
a violent fall from the cliffs and has been
wounded in the head and in the leg, so that he has
lost consciousness.”</p>

<p>The questioner exchanged glances with the other
men, and then continued:</p>

<p>“You tell the truth, to be sure, Fenice Cattaneo, because
you know how to lie so badly. If he has lost
consciousness, how could he send you here to announce
it to us?”</p>

<p>“Speech came back to him for a moment. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_781">[Pg 781]</span>
said that he was expected at the Fortuna; that it
should be made known there what had happened to
him.”</p>

<p>A dry laugh was audible from one of the other
men.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the speaker, “these gentlemen here
put no great faith in your tale. Truly, it is easier to
play the poet than the man of honor.”</p>

<p>“If you mean, signor, that out of cowardice Signor
Filippo does not come, it is an abominable lie, which
may Heaven put down to your account,” she said
firmly, and looked at each of the men in turn.</p>

<p>“You are warm, little one,” mocked the man. “Are
you, perhaps, the very good friend of the gentleman,
the lawyer, heh?”</p>

<p>“No, the Madonna is witness!” said she, in her
richest voice. The men whispered together, and she
heard one of them say: “The Aerie,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> too, is in Tuscany.
You do not really believe in this trick, do
you?” The third interrupted him: “He lies no more
in Treppi than—”</p>

<p>“Come and see for yourself,” Fenice broke into
their whispering. “But you shall not carry weapons,
if I am to guide you.”</p>

<p>“Little fool,” said the first speaker. “Think you
that we will risk our lives for such a trim little creature
as you are?”</p>

<p>“No, but for him; that I know.”</p>

<p>“Have you any other special conditions to impose,
Fenice Cattaneo?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_782">[Pg 782]</span></p>
<p>“Yes, that a surgeon accompanies us. Is there one
among you, Signori?”</p>

<p>She received no answer. Instead of which the three
men put their heads together. “As we came by, I
saw him by chance in front of his house; it is to be
hoped that he has not yet returned to the city,” said
one of them, and then left the pavilion. He returned
after a short time with a fourth, whom the company
did not seem to know.</p>

<p>“Will you do us the kindness of going up with us
to Treppi?” The spokesman addressed him. “You
will be informed on the way what is the business in
hand.”</p>

<p>The other bowed silently, and they all left the pavilion.
As they passed the kitchen, Fenice provided
herself with some bread and took a few bites of it.
Then she went on ahead of the company again and
struck into the path leading to the mountain. She
paid no attention to her companions, who were talking
excitedly among themselves, but hurried on as fast
as she could, so that they had to call her several times
for fear they should lose her from their sight. Then
she stopped and waited, and in hopeless brooding
gazed out into empty space, her hand pressed close
to her heart. So the evening wore on before they
arrived at the height.</p>

<p>The village of Treppi looked no livelier than usual.
Only the faces of a few children stirred in curiosity
at the windows, and a few old women appeared under
their doorways as Fenice passed by with her companions.
She spoke with no one, but went straight to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_783">[Pg 783]</span>
home, returning the neighbors’ greetings with a curt
wave of the hand. Here before the door stood a
group of men deep in conversation, servants were
busy with packed horses, and contrabbandieri were
going to and fro. When they saw the strangers coming,
there was a panic among the people. They drew
aside and let the company pass. Fenice exchanged a
few words with Nina in the great hall and then opened
the door of her room. In there, in the dimness, could
be seen the wounded man, stretched out on the bed,
and kneeling on the ground beside him a very old
woman of Treppi.</p>

<div class="chapter"><p>“How is he getting on, chiaruccia?” (chirurgeon)
asked Fenice.</p>
</div>

<p>“Not badly, praise the Madonna!” answered the old
woman, and with sharp glances inspected the gentlemen
who were entering behind the young girl.</p>

<p>Filippo started up from a half sleep and his pale
face suddenly glowed: “It is you!” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am bringing the gentlemen with whom you
intended to fight, that they may see for themselves that
you could not come. There’s a surgeon here, also.”</p>

<p>The feeble glance of the man lying there stole
slowly over the four strange faces. “He is not among
them,” he said. “I do not know any of these gentlemen.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, and was about to close his eyes again,
the spokesman stepped out from among the three and
said: “It is enough that we know <em>you</em>, Signor Filippo
Mannini. We have orders to wait and to arrest you.
Letters of yours have been seized, from which it appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_784">[Pg 784]</span>
that you have set foot in Tuscany again not only
in order to settle the duel, but also to establish a certain
society for the purpose of lending aid to your
party at Bologna. You see before you the Commissary
of Police and here are my orders.”</p>

<p>He drew a paper from his pocket and held it before
Filippo’s face. But the latter only stared at it, as if
he understood nothing of the matter, and fell back
again into his sleep-like stupor.</p>

<p>“Examine the wound, Doctor”—the Commissary
now turned to the surgeon. “If his condition will
allow it at all, we must carry the gentleman down
without delay. I saw some horses outside there. We
can accomplish two acts of the law at once if we take
possession of them, for they are laden with smuggled
goods. It is a lucky thing one knows what sort of
people visit Treppi when one wants to know it.”</p>

<p>As he said this, and the surgeon approached Filippo,
Fenice disappeared from the room. The old chirurgeon
remained quietly sitting and mumbling to herself.
Voices were heard without and an unusual disturbance
of going to and fro, and at the hole in the
wall faces looked in and quickly disappeared again.</p>

<p>“It is possible,” the surgeon now said, “for us to
take him down if we bind him tight with a twofold
bandage. Frankly, he would recover more rapidly if
he were left here in this peaceful spot and in the care
of this old witch, whose medicinal herbs put the most
learned physician to shame. The fever may endanger
his life on the way, and I will in no case take the
responsibility, Mr. Commissary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_785">[Pg 785]</span></p>

<p>“Unnecessary, unnecessary,” replied the other.
“<em>How</em> to get rid of him does not enter into the question.
So bind your rags about him, as tight as you
can, so that none of them may slip, and then forward.
We have the moonlight and are taking a young fellow
along with us as guide. Meanwhile, go out, Molza,
and secure the horses.”</p>

<p>The police officer whom the order concerned opened
the door of the room quickly and was about to go out
when an unexpected sight turned him to stone. The
room adjoining was occupied by a crowd of village
folk, at whose head stood two contrabbandieri. Fenice
was still addressing them as the door opened.
Now she stepped to the threshold of the room, and
said, with sharp emphasis:</p>

<p>“You will leave this room instantly, gentlemen, and
without the wounded man, or you will never see Pistoja
again. No blood has ever yet flowed in this
house as long as Fenice Cattaneo has been mistress of
it, and may the Madonna prevent any such crime for
all time to come. Do not try to return, either, with
more men. You still bear in mind, perhaps, the spot
where one has to climb up, one by one, the rock staircase.
A single child can defend this pass, if he rolls
down the steep the stones that lie scattered up on top
as if sown there. We will place a watch there until
this gentleman is in safety. Now, go and boast
abroad of your heroism, how you have played a young
girl false and wished to murder a wounded man.”</p>

<p>The faces of the officers turned paler and paler, and
after the last words there followed a pause. Then, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_786">[Pg 786]</span>
if at a word of command, they all three drew from
their pockets the pistols that had up to now been concealed,
and deliberately the Commissary said: “We
come in the name of the law. If you do not respect
it yourself, will you still hinder others from executing
it? It may cost six of you your lives if you compel
us to procure the law by force.”</p>

<p>A murmur passed through the crowd of the others.
“Be still, friends,” cried the resolute girl. “They
dare not do it. They know that every man they shoot
will bring a sixfold death upon the murderer. You
speak like a fool,” she said, turning again to the Commissary.
“The fear that sits on your brows speaks,
at least, more reasonably. Do as fear advises you.
The way is open, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>She stepped back and pointed with her left hand
toward the front door of the house. Those in the
room whispered a few words together, then with conciliatory
bearing they walked through the excited
crowd, which with ever-increasing curses made way
for them. The surgeon was undecided which he
should follow; but at an imperious nod from the
young girl, he hastily joined his companions.</p>

<p>This whole scene had been witnessed by the big
eyes of the sick man in the chamber, who had half
risen. Now the old woman went back to him and
smoothed his pillow for him.</p>

<p>“Lie still, my son!” said she, “there is no danger.
Sleep, sleep, poor son, the old chiaruccia watches, and
that you may be still more secure, that is our Fenice’s
care, the blessed child! Sleep, sleep!” She crooned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_787">[Pg 787]</span>
him to sleep with monotonous songs, like a child. But
he took the name of Fenice with him into his dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Filippo was ten days up there in the mountains and
in the care of the old woman, slept much by night,
and by day, sitting before the door, enjoyed the clear
air and the peacefulness of it all. As soon as he was
able to write again, he sent a messenger with a letter
to Bologna, and the next day received an answer.
Whether welcome or unwelcome was not to be read
in his pale face. Except to his nurse and the children
of Treppi he spoke to no one, and he saw Fenice daily
during the evening, when she was kept busy about the
house. At sunrise she left the house and remained
all day in the mountains. Formerly it had been otherwise,
as he gathered from her chance utterances. But
even when she was at home there was never an opportunity
to speak to her. She went about in general as
if perfectly unconscious of his presence, and appeared
to be ordering her life as formerly, yet her face had
become like stone and her eyes as dead.</p>

<p>When Filippo, one day, enticed by the beautiful
weather, had wandered farther than usual from the
house, and with the feeling of new strength was climbing
an easy height, he was startled as he turned the
corner of a rock and unexpectedly saw Fenice sitting
on the moss near a spring. She had distaff and spindle
in her hands, and during the spinning appeared
to be much absorbed. At Filippo’s step she looked up,
but spoke not a word, yet the expression of her face
changed, and she quickly gathered up all her tools.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_788">[Pg 788]</span>
Then she went away, without heeding his call, and was
soon out of sight.</p>

<p>The morning after this incident, he had just risen
and his first thoughts were again turned to her, when
the door of his room opened and the young girl calmly
appeared before him. She remained standing at the
threshold, and signed to him imperiously with her
hand, as he was about to approach her hastily from
the window.</p>

<p>“You are cured once more,” she said coldly. “I
have spoken with the old woman. She thinks you have
strength to travel again by short day stages and on
horseback. You will leave Treppi early in the morning,
and never return. This promise I demand of
you!”</p>

<p>“I promise it, Fenice, on one condition.”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>“That you go with me, Fenice!” He spoke with
great, uncontrolled emotion.</p>

<p>A dark frown of anger overclouded her brow. But
she restrained herself, and said, holding on to the door-knob:
“In what way have I deserved to be made
sport of? Make the promise without condition. I expect
it on your <em>honor</em>, Signor!”</p>

<p>“Will you so thrust me aside, after you have instilled
your love charm into me to the very core and
made me your own forever, Fenice?”</p>

<p>She calmly shook her head. “There is no longer
any charm between us,” she said in a hollow voice.
“You lost blood before the drink worked; the spell
is broken. And it is well that it is so, for I have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_789">[Pg 789]</span>
wrong. Do not let us speak of it any more and only
say that you will go. A horse will be ready and a guide
for wherever you will.”</p>

<p>“If it is no longer magic that binds me to you, there
is surely something else, for which you have no remedy.
May God be gracious to me—”</p>

<p>“Be still!” she interrupted him, and closed her lips
tightly. “I am deaf to such words as you are going
to speak. If you think there is something due to me
and are trying to pity me—then go and the account
is therewith balanced. You shall not think that this
poor head of mine can learn nothing. I know now
that one can not buy a human being—as little by the
pitiable services that go as a matter of course, as by
seven years of waiting—which is also a matter of
course, before God. You shall not think that you have
made me unhappy. You have cured me! Go, and
take my thanks with you!”</p>

<p>“Answer me, before God!” he cried, beside himself,
and went nearer to her, “have I cured you also of your
<em>love</em>?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said firmly. “What is that to you? That
is my affair; you have neither right nor power over it.
Go.”</p>

<p>With that she stepped back and over the threshold.
The next moment he had fallen on the stones at her
feet and was clasping her knees.</p>

<p>“If it is true, what you say,” he cried in greatest
sorrow, “then save me, receive me, take me up to you,
or this brain, which only a miracle has kept together,
will burst in pieces, along with the heart that you wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_790">[Pg 790]</span>
to thrust aside. My world is empty, my love the prey
of hate, my old and my new home banished me; what
have I to live for, if I must also lose you!”</p>

<p>Then he looked up at her and saw the bright tears
breaking from her closed eyes. Her face was still
motionless; then she took a deep breath, her eyes
opened, her lips moved, still without words. At one
touch life was again blossoming in her. She bent down
over him, her strong arms lifted him up—“You are
mine!” she whispered trembling. “So will I be yours.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The sun as it rose the next day saw the pair on their
way to Genoa where Filippo decided to retire before
the plots of his enemies. The tall, pale man rode upon
a safe horse, which his wife was leading by the bridle.
On both sides extended in the clearness of the autumn
the heights and depths of the beautiful Apennines;
eagles circled above the ravines, and far away in the
distance glistened the sea. And calm and shining like
the ocean there the future lay before the wanderers.</p>

<p><em>“The Stonebreakers,” written in 1869, marks
an epoch in German literature—it is the first
of the “Arbeiternovellen”—short stories of real
laboring life.</em></p>

<p><em>The author, an Austrian nobleman, was born
in Vienna in 1833. After the Italian campaign
of 1859, he devoted himself to literature. Popularity,
though late, came to him at last. In 1904
Vienna voted him an annual honorary stipend,
and gave him a recognition that no Austrian author
had received since the time of Grillparzer—he
was elected to the Austrian Upper House.</em></p>

<p><em>Von Saar’s position in literature is that of
creator of the short story in Austria. His style
is stately, calm, dignified, delicate, sympathetic,
polished—one of the modern masters, with a
profound knowledge of life in all its phases.</em></p>

<p><em>He has written comparatively little—besides
his short stories, a few novels, dramas, idyls,
occasionally touched, as in “The Stonebreakers,”
with a natural, easy, tentative realism. He died
in the latter part of 1906.</em></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable feats of civil
engineering is the railway across the Semmering,
a part of the Noric Alps, forming
the borderline between the Duchy of Austria and
the green plains of Styria. In these days the impression
left upon the mind is not so overpowering, but
years ago, when the road was new, travelers must
have felt the astonishment and awe of men who see
for the first time before their very eyes things believed
by them to be impossible.</p>

<p>Along the tracks, winding about yawning abysses
or deep walls of solid rock, the trains thunder over
the dizzy heights of the viaducts, or with shrill whistle
disappear into the night of seemingly endless tunnels.
Long before Mont Cenis was bored through, or the
Isthmus of Suez finished, trains of the Semmering
issued from the tunnel and reached level ground,
leaving their dangers behind, hurrying onward over
the smiling meadows; surprise and awe soon changed
to pride in the progress of the times, and the traveling
son of the century, leaning back in his seat with
half-closed eyes, must often have dreamed of the
further marvels to be accomplished in time to come.
But few, indeed, ever gave a thought to the thousands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_794">[Pg 794]</span>who, in the sweat of their brow and exposed to every
kind of danger, had blasted the rocks, rolled the boulders,
bridged the deep gorges, and, in fact, <em>created</em>
that much-admired road that now carries us so easily
from the restless, dust-swept metropolis to the shores
of the blue Adriatic.</p>

<p>And now I am going to tell you a short story about
two of these poor people, belonging to a class that from
time immemorial has been faithfully doing its part in
the great work of universal civilization. Alas! They
have not yet reaped many of the benefits of this progress.
But it is not my intention here to paint in vivid
colors the unhappy fate of those pariahs of society
who build our cathedrals and palaces, our universities
and museums; nor do I wish to enlarge on the
part which this so-called fifth class may have to play
in the course of events—that I will leave to the sociologists.
I wish to show you only a simple picture,
drawn from the life of the masses whose meagre existence,
with its terrible struggle for daily bread, goes
on unknown and unnoticed, and finally passes away
in some obscure corner without leaving a trace. I
only wish to show you that in a small way the world’s
great tragedies repeat themselves everywhere.</p>

<p>The railway across the Semmering was finished.
The cyclopean noise of the labor, the thunder of the
blasting shots had died out, and the countless and restless
crowds that had gathered here, coming from distant
Bohemia, from the lowlands of Moravia and
Hungary, from the stony Karst and sunny Friuli, had
moved on toward the south to continue their labors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_795">[Pg 795]</span>
there. The wild animals that had been driven back
into the deep woods were returning, and, as if out
of curiosity, ventured upon the road which, still unused,
was resting here like a forgotten trace of human
energy in the quiet peace of the mountain. Only here
and there, separated by a two hours’ walk, perhaps,
stood one of those large log cabins which the nomads
of labor had once inhabited in swarms, and then in
many cases torn down again on the eve of departure.
In these parts were still living a number of laborers
who had either been left behind or had arrived later,
in order to put the finishing touches to the railway;
for there were still tracks to be laid, the space between
the rails to be filled out with crushed stone, telegraph
poles to be erected, and the masonry work on the small
houses built for the watchmen to be completed, although
the graceful swallows, that perched all day in
long rows on the electric wires, had begun to build
their nests under the eaves.</p>

<p>On the threshold of one of these log cabins—it
stood at some distance back from the tracks, supported
against a steep, rocky wall—sat a woman.
She was barefooted, had a coarse, dark kerchief over
her head, and the face underneath looked worn and
showed that sallow complexion which constant work
in the hot sun gives to a naturally pale face. Her
brow was deeply lined, and around the mouth lay such
a sad, forlorn expression that it made the woman appear
much older than her years, and served to accentuate
the immaturity of her form. The sun no longer
stood high in the sky; most of the mountain-tops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_796">[Pg 796]</span>
slopes were already in deep shadow. But on the
meadow in front of the house, and in the tree-tops
along the wooded slope at its side, there still sparkled
the bright sunshine, in which swarms of butterflies,
bees, and dragon-flies played, dancing over the gay
flowers.</p>

<p>The lonely woman heeded none of all this grace and
loveliness that summer had spread before her; she
never looked away from her work of repairing the
torn blouse of some one of the men. It was hard
work, for her rough, callous hands, which held the
needle rather awkwardly, had probably been used to
only hoe and shovel. Approaching footsteps roused
her finally, and, looking up, she noticed a man coming
from the tracks toward the house; his appearance
was pitiable. Over his small, weak-looking body he
wore a much tattered soldier’s coat, which, far too
long and wide, hung loosely about him, while a torn
blue foraging cap was drawn far down over his face.
He swayed in walking, although he held in his hand
a knotty stick, on which he leaned heavily at times; the
small knapsack that he carried strapped to his back
was too empty to be much of a burden. As he drew
nearer, his tired, colorless eyes looked shyly and embarrassed
at the woman, who was watching him. “Is
this Cabin No. 7?” he asked in a somewhat uncertain
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” she answered, in that strange, harsh-sounding
dialect spoken in Southern Bohemia. “What
do you want?”</p>

<p>“I have been sent here to work.” And he showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_797">[Pg 797]</span>
her a slip of paper which he held in his hand. The
woman was still looking with wonder at his strange
dress and at the face so miserably pale and emaciated
under the slight growth of beard. “The foreman is
not at home,” she said at last. “He has gone down
the mountain to Schottwien to get a drink of wine.
Sit down here in the mean time, if you are tired.”
And with one more look at the worn figure, she hastily
took up her needle and thread again, suddenly remembering
the work in which he had interrupted her. The
man said nothing, only dragged himself a few steps
farther, and then sat down on the grass with every
indication of complete exhaustion. There he lay,
while the sun sank lower and lower. Not a sound
disturbed the peace; only high up in the azure of the
evening sky a vulture was circling, emitting a long,
drawn-out cry. Suddenly they heard in the distance
the singing of rough and coarse voices. The busy
woman started: “Heavens, there they are,” she said
to herself, “and the blouse is not yet finished.”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the singing, and before
long there appeared a crowd of wild-looking fellows;
in their midst, better dressed than the others, towered
a man of Herculean size. He was probably fifty years
of age; his broad and bloated face showed the effects
of heavy drinking. Under the straw hat, which he
had pushed far back, his gray hair hung in tangles.
He had taken off his coat and thrown it over his left
shoulder. In his right hand, that stretched, fat but
sinewy, out of the loose sleeve, he carried a large
basket, filled with provisions of all kinds. Two of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_798">[Pg 798]</span>
other men carried heavy sacks with potatoes on their
backs.</p>

<p>“Hello! Tertschka!” (Theresa) called out the man
with the basket, in a hoarse voice; “give us some light
in the house, so that we can take the provisions into
the cellar.” But when he stood before her and noticed
the blouse she was holding in her trembling grasp,
he added harshly: “Well, is it finished?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” she answered timidly.</p>

<p>“What? Not yet?” he shouted, and his face took
on a bluish hue. “Did I not tell you that I needed it
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I have worked hard all the afternoon, but I
can’t sew as fast as one who has learned to do
such work.”</p>

<p>The gentle yet firm tone in which she said these
words seemed to enrage him all the more. “You always
find some excuse!” he cried. “But I tell you,
if I don’t have that blouse to-morrow morning something
will happen to you!” Putting his basket on the
ground, he made a movement toward the frightened
woman as if he were going to strike her. Just then
he noticed the man in the soldier’s coat, who was approaching
timidly. “Who is that?” the furious man
asked, dropping the hand that had been raised to deal
the blow.</p>

<p>“He has been sent here to work,” Tertschka said,
breathing heavily.</p>

<p>The foreman, for he it was, planted himself with
all the heaviness and importance of his big bulk before
the small man, looking him over from head to foot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_799">[Pg 799]</span>
“To work? Why, the fellow can’t even stand on his
feet!”</p>

<p>“I have had a long tramp,” the other said. “I come
from Ottertal.”</p>

<p>“That is something wonderful!” sneered the foreman,
trying to read in the dim light a slip of paper
that was now passed to him by the trembling hand.
“Your name is Huber?” he asked after a while, looking
up again.</p>

<p>“Yes, George Huber.”</p>

<p>“How did you get that uniform?”</p>

<p>“I am a soldier on furlough.”</p>

<p>“What? You have served in the army?”</p>

<p>“Yes; seven years in the twelfth regiment. They
sent me home now because I can not get rid of the
fever I caught during the siege of Venice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fever, too! Well, they take all kinds of people
in the offices! Most of them are cripples, to be
used only as stone-crushers. Now, remember,” he
added, raising his fist in a threatening manner, “if
you don’t show me every evening two loads of crushed
stone as a day’s work, I will discharge you. This is
not a hospital!” He took up the basket and went into
the house, followed by the others. There he unlocked
a heavy door plated all over with sheets of iron; it led
into a cave that had been blasted into the rock and
was now used as a cellar. While Tertschka held as a
candle the piece of resinous pine which she had taken
from the big hearth and lighted, the provisions were
packed away. The foreman closed the door and retired
behind a partition; the others stretched themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_800">[Pg 800]</span>
out on straw, chattering among themselves,
without noticing their new comrade.</p>

<p>George waited timidly at the entrance door; at last
Tertschka went up to him. “Go and sleep there,” she
said, pointing to the straw.</p>

<p>He obeyed her, anxiously trying to occupy as little
room as possible; he put his knapsack under his head,
used his coat as a cover, and with a heavy sigh settled
himself to sleep. Tertschka lighted a small oil lamp
and, crouching near the hearth, took up her sewing
again. At last she put the needle away and examined
the blouse closely. Satisfied with her completed task,
she blew out the smoking lamp and lay down near the
hearth for the night, just as she was. Outside the
summer night was filling everything with fragrance,
and down through the opening in the roof the twinkling
stars were shining into the dark room, the stillness
of which was broken only by the breathing of the
sleepers.</p>

<p>With the first signs of dawn, life began to stir in
the house, and George awakened. He watched the
men leave their crude beds, looking for the tools that
had been left leaning against the wall; then they left
the house. He, too, had risen, put on his coat, and
now waited anxiously, not knowing what to do.
Tertschka, carrying a heavy hammer with a very long
handle over her shoulder, said: “The foreman is still
asleep, but I know what your work is to be. Take that
other hammer, and, if you like, you may go with
me.” Together they went out into the open air. It
was cool and still; now and then a bird sang; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_801">[Pg 801]</span>
meadows glittered with dew. Silently the two walked
to the road, and then along the tracks to an old stone
quarry; here they found some of the men already at
work, while others were busy at the tracks with carts
and shovels. Tertschka went up a little higher with
George until they reached a hollow. “This is my
place,” she said, sitting down on the ground in the
midst of stones and gravel. “I do not like to stay
with the others; they are unruly and malicious. But
you may stay here, if you like.” Without answering,
he sat down. “You see, all these broken stones have
to be crushed into small pieces.” And, pointing to
a pile of them, she added: “All that I have done this
week.” He pulled a large limestone toward him and
dealt it a blow with his hammer; the stone did not
break. “Strike harder,” said Tertschka; and she herself
made the stones fly in all directions by her blows.
He looked at her in astonishment and tried his
strength once more. This time he had better success,
so the two were soon eagerly at work without speaking
at all.</p>

<p>The view from the place where they sat was wonderful
and extensive, showing the gigantic heights
and deep valleys of the mountain range. Quite close
to the tracks and on a level with the road, the ruins
of Castle Klamm could be seen, clinging to the rocks
like an eagle’s nest. Down below in the narrow valley
lay the small town of Schottwien with its red
roofs. Behind towered the Sonnwendstein, and at its
foot, on green meadows and surrounded by trees, stood
the little church, called “Maria Schutz.” But those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_802">[Pg 802]</span>
two busy people had no glance for the exquisite picture;
with heads bent to the ground, they hammered
and hammered incessantly, eagerly, dully. The sun
climbed higher and began to shine burning hot on
their heads. George’s blows grew weaker and weaker;
at last he dropped the hammer, took off his cap, and
wiped his brow, on which the perspiration stood in
large drops. Tertschka stopped for a moment, too,
and looked at him kindly. “Are you tired already?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“God knows, I am,” he said, almost inaudibly; “the
fever has weakened me more than I thought.”</p>

<p>“But why did you come here, if you are so sick and
faint?” she asked.</p>

<p>“What else could I do? Go begging? <em>Never!</em> I
did not learn a trade, for my father and mother died
when I was a small child; so I had to mind the geese
and later the cows in our village until I was eighteen
years old. None of the peasants ever hired me for
work; I was not strong enough. The recruiting officers
thought differently; they took me and put me into
the white coat, saying: ‘He is good enough to run
along in the second rank.’ Then when I was sick and
miserable they sent me home. For a time the home
parish took care of me. Then they, too, sent me
away to work—to crush stones up here. Well, I do
crush stones,” he concluded, and a bitter smile passed
over his face as he again took up the hammer.</p>

<p>She had listened quietly; and now very gently she
said: “You can never stand such work!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can, if I could only get something to eat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_803">[Pg 803]</span>
I have had bad luck lately, and since yesterday morning
I have not had a morsel to eat.”</p>

<p>She did not answer immediately, but took out a
piece of black rye bread, which she had wrapped into
her apron, broke it and gave him the larger piece.
“Eat that!” she said.</p>

<p>He looked at it. “But that is yours, and you need
it,” he said, gently declining it.</p>

<p>“Never mind! I have enough left for myself,” she
answered.</p>

<p>And when he made no effort to take it, she laid it
on the ground close to him. “You must be thirsty,
too,” she continued. “I will get you a drink of water;
there is a good spring a little higher up.” She arose,
picked up a broken jug that was lying between the
stones, and climbed to a place above the quarry, where
some fir trees were growing and a small stream of
water trickled from under the moss. She filled the
jug, drank, filled it again, and returned. George had
not yet touched the bread, but accepted the water
gladly and gratefully.</p>

<p>“But now you must eat,” she urged him, sitting
down again. “You needn’t hesitate to take it from
me.”</p>

<p>With rather a shamefaced manner he reached for
the bread. “I suppose you have gone through a great
deal of suffering or you wouldn’t be so kind,” he said,
without looking at her, and, breaking off a small piece
of the bread, he began to eat.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I have. Even now I know often enough
what it means to go without food.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_804">[Pg 804]</span></p>

<p>He felt as if he could not swallow his piece of
bread. “Even now?” he asked after a while. “Do
they pay so badly for work here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t receive any pay at all.”</p>

<p>“Why? What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“The foreman keeps my wages.”</p>

<p>“The foreman keeps your wages?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is my stepfather.”</p>

<p>“Your stepfather?” he repeated, quite stupefied
with astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes; my own father met with an accident and died
when I was very young; he was killed by some falling
timber and earth. After his death my mother stayed
with the foreman, who was at that time a dike laborer
like my own father; they were working together in
Bohemia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are from Bohemia? That is the reason
you speak with a different accent and have such a
strange name! Ter— I can not pronounce it.”</p>

<p>“Tertschka,” she said. “It means ‘Therese,’ in
German.”</p>

<p>“Here in Austria they would call you Resi. But,”
he continued, “if your stepfather takes your wages, he
must at least give you enough to eat.”</p>

<p>“Just enough to keep me from starving. You have
no idea how stingy he is. He himself lives well;
scarcely a day passes without his drinking too much;
but to others he would not give even a drop of water
unless they paid him for it; he could see them all
starve first before he would voluntarily give them a
bite to eat. So I have to content myself with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_805">[Pg 805]</span>
leavings, while he keeps my wages and also the forty
florins<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which my mother left to me. And that is not
the worst. He is brutal and malicious and beats me
cruelly quite often. You saw yourself yesterday how
he lost his temper on account of the blouse I was
mending for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did see it.”</p>

<p>“My poor mother he treated in the same way. I
firmly believe she sickened and finally died of consumption
brought on in consequence of a violent blow
he dealt her on the chest when he came home intoxicated
and in a bad temper.”</p>

<p>She was silent for a while, lost in all these sad
memories. Finally George said: “If your stepfather
treats you so badly, why do you stay with him?”</p>

<p>“Because I know he would never let me go away,”
she answered. “He needs this poor, helpless creature
whom he can torture at will. With all his brutality
and violent temper, he is, after all, just a coward.
And besides—where should I go?” she added with a
deep sigh. She took up the hammer again; George,
now a little stronger, reached for his, too, and soon
they were both hard at work.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed; the burning heat of midday
lay oppressively over mountains and valleys; not
a sign of life anywhere, save the monotonous click of
the hammers and now and then the call of a woodpecker
and the rough singing of the men working
along the tracks.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the shrill sound of a bell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_806">[Pg 806]</span></p>
<p>“What is that?” asked George, noticing that the
laborers had laid down their tools and were walking
toward the house.</p>

<p>“The foreman rang the bell; it is meal-time.”</p>

<p>“Is it time to eat?” he asked, with a faint voice.
“What do you get here?”</p>

<p>“Buckwheat gruel and potatoes. To-day probably
some roast pork, too; they brought some meat up
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“It is very long since I tasted meat the last time,”
he said thoughtfully. “Who is doing the cooking
here, tell me?”</p>

<p>“The foreman; he does not trust any one else. Besides,
he likes to do it. This work up here he cares
very little about and lets it all drift. Once in a while
he goes about and inspects, never without scolding and
cursing, especially those who have not the courage to
answer back. And now I will give you a piece of
advice: do not eat any meat to-day. You are still
suffering from the fever, and it might hurt you. For
you must know that man has no conscience whatever
and often buys bad meat from the butcher at Schottwien.
He pays very little for it and sells it here at
a high price, for the railway officers have given him
the sole right to deal in provisions, and every one here
is compelled to buy from him all that is necessary; so
he makes a great deal of money.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is no danger of my buying any meat,”
said George bitterly. “I have no money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he would be glad enough to give you credit
until Sunday, when the wages are paid. But woe to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_807">[Pg 807]</span>
you if you owe him money! He will not only charge
you double for everything you take, but he will force
you to drink and gamble with him until you are altogether
at his mercy. You will never see one penny of
your own money and will be forever in his power!”</p>

<p>George grew frightened as he listened to her. “But
how can I manage to live until Sunday?” he said,
crestfallen. “To-day is only Wednesday, and if I am
not to take anything on credit I shall have to starve.”</p>

<p>For some minutes she busied herself with the hem
of her skirt, ripping out a part of the seam. At last
she took out a crumpled paper, which she unfolded
carefully; it was one of those notes of low denomination
that circulated in Austria at that time and answered
the purpose of coin; they were called “quarters.”
She passed this to George. “Take it,” she
said; “that is enough until Sunday, if you are careful.
You can return it to me little by little, taking it from
your wages every week.”</p>

<p>He looked at the tattered paper in her hand, speechless
with emotion. Surprise, joy, embarrassment, one
after the other were reflected in his face.</p>

<p>“It is all that I have,” she continued with simple
confidence. “The engineer gave it to me when he was
here last month. He had forgotten one of his instruments
he had left at another station, and I had to get
it for him. Really, it would please me very much if
you would take the money. I am in constant fear of
losing it; that is why I sewed it into my skirt. If the
foreman knew of it he would have taken it long ago.”
She put it into his hand, adding: “And now let us go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_808">[Pg 808]</span>
to dinner. Don’t forget what I told you about the
meat. The flour is often musty, too; but there will
be good potatoes at least; they brought some yesterday.
And in the evening you might allow yourself a
glass of gin; that will do you good.” He got up and
followed her silently; but for a few steps he stood
still, looked earnestly into her gentle, brown eyes, and
said with trembling voice:</p>

<p>“How can I ever thank you enough, Tertschka?
No one has ever been as kind and good to me as
you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t speak of it,” she answered; “we ought
to help one another in this world. And, besides, you
would do the same for me, I know. You are kind,
too; I saw it in your face when you came to the house
yesterday.” By this time they had reached the house.
Inside they found the others, most of them eating
from broken dishes. The foreman, with sleeves turned
up and a big apron tied in front, stood by the stove,
ready to carve a large piece of roast beef. Poor
George heaved an involuntary sigh when he smelt the
savory odor of the roast. All the men looked greedily
at it, and each one in turn received a large piece, which
he ate with his hand. Some of them paid in coin, but
only a very few; the others bought on credit, the foreman
keeping an account in a little book. George approached
the man, holding a dish that Tertschka had
given him. At first the foreman did not recognize
him, but soon he remembered: “Oh, there is the little
man who came yesterday!” he cried. “Well, have you
done any work?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_809">[Pg 809]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I have crushed stones!”</p>

<p>“And now you want something to eat, I see. What
shall I give you?”</p>

<p>“I would like some porridge and potatoes.”</p>

<p>The foreman filled his plate and took the money that
George gave him. “Of course, you want a piece of
meat, too?” he said.</p>

<p>It was a great temptation to the poor man, but he
remembered Tertschka’s advice, and only said:</p>

<p>“No, I do not care for meat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a niggard! You look starved; you
ought to be glad to get something decent to eat.”</p>

<p>“He has the fever,” said Tertschka; “the fat meat
might hurt him;” for she felt that George’s willpower
needed support to withstand the other man’s
gruff importunity.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” he shouted. “How do you
know what is good or bad for him! Don’t you interfere;
this is none of your business!” And turning to
George, he asked again: “Well, do you want some meat
or not?”</p>

<p>The words sounded like a command, <em>not</em> to refuse
the tempting dish, but the man, shy as he was, took
all the courage he could summon, and answered: “She
is right; I ought not to eat any meat.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, don’t!” the other hissed, throwing the
knife aside. “I’m not going to beg you to take it!”
As George remained standing, he asked: “What else
do you want?”</p>

<p>“My change,” the other stammered.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes!” the foreman shouted. “Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_810">[Pg 810]</span>
think I am going to keep your miserable pennies?”
He threw him some copper coins and turned away
scornfully. The money scattered in every direction
about the room. George, with one hand occupied in
holding the dish with food in it, had some trouble in
picking up his change with the other. When finally
he sat down in the corner to eat, his meagre fare had
grown quite cold. He noticed that the foreman was
pouring gin from a large green bottle into a small
glass, then filling it again for the next man until nearly
all had had their turn. George consoled himself with
the thought of the treat in the evening, as Tertschka
had advised. The girl too had received her dinner,
meagre as it was, and now, at her stepfather’s command,
began to wash and scrub the cooking utensils.
The workmen had already left the house and were
seeking the shade outside, to stretch their tired bodies
and have a short nap. The foreman now began to
make preparations for his own meal; he took a small
pan from the stove and put it on the table, with plate,
knife, and fork; to these were added a bottle of wine
and a glass. Then he sat down lazily, lifted a nice,
fat chicken from the pan, and began to eat. All at
once he noticed George, who was still sitting in the
corner, with the empty dish between his knees, considering
how he might manage to help Tertschka with
her work, for secret fear of the brutal man before him
made him hesitate. “What are you sitting there for,
staring at me?” he heard him shout. “Leave the room
as quick as you can! I don’t want any spies here, to
watch every mouthful I eat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_811">[Pg 811]</span></p>

<p>George went out and lay down in the sun, all the
shade being occupied by the others. After a while
the bell sounded for work again; the foreman went
into his room to rest. The men stretched and yawned
and went very leisurely to work, some of them, indeed,
not getting up at all, but turning over again for
another nap. George and Tertschka went quietly to
the quarry, and labored hard and faithfully until evening.
During the days following they always worked
together. George seemed to improve rapidly; he had
enough to eat, and the invigorating air of this high
altitude had a very lively effect upon his body, so worn
out by fever. He swung the hammer quite vigorously
now, and related to his companion his varied adventures
during years of service in the army. They were
by no means gay adventures, such as might happen
in the life of a soldier of spirit; for, unfortunately,
his shy and hangdog manner had caused him a great
deal of trouble, so that he had seen only the dark side
of a profession in which so many others find pleasure
and excitement. He told her of his sufferings at the
time he was a raw recruit, and when the tyranny of
the corporal made life not worth living; of long nights
of picket duty in snow and ice, of tiresome marches,
followed by camping in rain and storm, and then—most
interesting of all—of the time during the siege
of Venice, when he stood with his regiment before
Fort Malghera, where so many hundreds of them had
died of typhoid and cholera. Tertschka listened attentively,
although she understood only half of what
he told her. It was all so far removed from her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_812">[Pg 812]</span>
life that she could not even picture any of it to herself.
How could she imagine a city built in the water!
Even the word “ocean” meant nothing more to her
than did a vague, far-away cloud. Yet instinctively
she felt that George’s life had been full of trouble, and
in turn she told him all that she remembered of the
sadness and misery in her own dull and monotonous
existence. So they consoled each other, and were glad
that they could go to work every morning together,
and spend the long sunny days in the quiet quarry.
Often they missed the call of the dinner-bell, or were
startled by it, vexed because it compelled them to
leave a solitude that had become so dear to them,
and go down and mix with the rowdy men at the
house.</p>

<p>But the time was not long during which these two
were being drawn closer and closer together by their
poverty, as others are by joy and pleasure and exuberance
of life. Whether the foreman received information
concerning them from some malevolent
person or perhaps guessed at the state of affairs with
the instinct of a bad heart, matters not; at any rate,
one day he suddenly surprised them. “What are you
doing here all by yourselves?” he cried. “Away with
you to your comrades, you poor thing, where you
belong!” With a gesture of command, he pointed
toward the lower part of the quarry. George, dumb
with fright, obeyed.</p>

<p>“And you, you spiteful creature,” turning to Tertschka,
“it seems to me you are too warm a friend
of that cripple there? Just wait, I will cure you! If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_813">[Pg 813]</span>
I see you together again, he shall be discharged and
you shall not see daylight for many a day.”</p>

<p>So they were separated, rudely and suddenly. After
that George was made to work on the tracks, and
when he and Tertschka met in the house at noon or
at sundown, they did not dare even to look at each
other, far less exchange words. For the foreman
observed them closely, and the others, too, seemed to
take a kind of malicious pleasure in watching them.</p>

<p>One evening—it was a Saturday—the foreman and
some of his companions had gone to an inn in one of
the villages not far away; the other men had settled
down to a game of cards, as usual, after receiving their
weekly wages. As the noise and excitement grew
louder and boisterous, George took courage to approach
Tertschka, who was sitting on an old wooden
box in her accustomed corner, her face buried in her
hands.</p>

<p>“Tertschka,” he said softly, taking a small, leather
bag from his pocket, “here is the rest of the money that
I owe you.” And he put some kreutzers<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> into her lap.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” she answered; “you had better
keep it, you may need it.”</p>

<p>“What for?” he asked, disappointed. “All pleasure
is gone for me since I can not work with you any
more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel the same,” she answered.</p>

<p>After a while he began again: “I wonder why he
separated us? It must be a matter of utter indifference
to him whether we sit together or not, as long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_814">[Pg 814]</span>
as we do our work well.” She was silent. At last
she said:</p>

<p>“He is a bad man, and can not bear to see any one
else having a good time. He never allows one to go
to church, yet he knows I can pray only when I am
kneeling before the altar. How often he has scolded
my mother because she wouldn’t for anything miss
going to church on Sunday, and always took me with
her; <em>he</em>, indeed, knows no God or religion. But to-morrow
I shall go to Schottwien, no matter what he
says or does; I don’t wish to become quite heathen
among all these drunkards and gamblers.”</p>

<p>She arose, opened the box on which she had been
sitting, took out a woolen jacket, a calico skirt, and
a pair of heavy shoes; also a faded, red kerchief and
an old rosary with a cross of brass on it. All these
things she laid carefully over the contents of the box,
and closed the cover again.</p>

<p>George watched her. “I, too, have not been to
church for a long time,” he said. “Wouldn’t it be
fine if I could go with you to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s impossible.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that,” he answered. “The
foreman need not know of it. We might leave here,
each alone on a different road, and then meet down in
the valley.”</p>

<p>She considered the plan. “You are right, it can be
done. But you must start long before me. Close to
the house, on the left side, is a narrow path, almost
hidden under the trees, that leads directly down into
the valley. When you come to the wooden cross on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_815">[Pg 815]</span>
the wayside, wait for me there. But you had better
leave me now,” she added, becoming anxious; “the
others may notice our talking together.”</p>

<p>He went back, threw himself on the straw, and fell
asleep in the midst of the noisy quarreling of the
gamblers.</p>

<p>The next morning, when George descended along
the path of which Tertschka had told him, the world
was full of bright sunshine. He looked eagerly ahead
to find the cross in the valley, where they were to meet,
and soon he saw it, toppling over and half rotten, surrounded
by a few pine saplings. When he reached the
spot he sat down on a moss-grown rock, which was
lying in front of the cross, forming a natural praying-stool.
The deep quiet of the Sabbath rested over everything;
even the bees did not seem to be humming exactly
as they flew over the dark-blue gentians that grew
here in plenty. George felt himself listening to something,
he knew not what, but it seemed like a solemn,
yet gentle, ringing of bells, high above him in the air.
But soon he became impatient. He walked about, picking
gentians and other flowers, yellow and white, and
thought as he looked at the nosegay in his hand: “I
will give these to Tertschka when she comes.” Finally
he plucked some ferns and put them into his cap, where
they waved like feathers. Now he saw a dress fluttering
in the wind on top of the hill, and quickly he ran
to meet her.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” she said, a little out of breath. “I got
away more easily than I expected.”</p>

<p>George looked at her. She was without the kerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_816">[Pg 816]</span>
which she always wore over her head; her hair was
parted simply and braided, and the red of her neckerchief
shed a soft glow over her face. The dark jacket,
somewhat broad, and the light skirt, both looked well
on her. “How nice you look,” he said slowly. She
blushed. “All these things belonged to my mother,”
she told him, stroking the stiff skirt, that it might fall
a little more gracefully. “I wear them so seldom, that
is why they keep so well.”</p>

<p>“Here are some flowers that I picked for you,” said
George. She took the bouquet which he had been hiding
behind his back, and was about to pin it to her
jacket, but it was too large, so she carried it in her
hand, around which she had wound the rosary. Then
they walked on through green meadows and fields,
where the grain had been cut and shocked, until they
came to Schottwien. Here there was great excitement;
it was kermess (a sort of church fair), and the
street was filled with vehicles and people in holiday
attire. Booths had been built near the church, where
all kinds of things were displayed for sale: kerchiefs
and pipes, knives and beads of glass or wax, cooking
utensils, gingerbread, and toys for the children.
George and Tertschka looked admiringly at all these
fine things, and George felt tempted to buy a pipe.
He had smoked when he was a soldier; later, during
his illness, he had to give it up, but now he thought,
since he was earning his bread again, and neither
drank nor gambled, he could allow himself the luxury.</p>

<p>Tertschka encouraged him when he told her of it,
adding that she would go on while he made his purchase.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_817">[Pg 817]</span>
“In the village church,” she said, “there are
too many people, but about half an hour farther on
is a lonely little church, where I have been before,
and wish to go again to-day.” She referred to the
church called “Maria Schutz,” at the foot of the
Sonnwendstein.</p>

<p>George made his way through groups of hagglers
and onlookers, and succeeded in buying a neat little
pipe, with a porcelain bowl with gay tassels hanging
from it. Suddenly a glittering ornament of yellow
glass beads attracted his attention; he could not help
thinking how nice it would look around Tertschka’s
neck. As the price was not too high, he bought it and
put it into his pocket after wrapping it carefully in
paper. With the few kreutzers left from his florin he
bought a large heart of gingerbread, and some tobacco,
and then, happy with all his treasures, he hastened
after Tertschka. He showed her first the pipe, which
she duly admired. Then he gave her the gingerbread
heart; it had a picture on it of another small heart,
pierced by an arrow, the whole surrounded by a wreath
of flowers. “That is for you!” he said. She looked
at it quietly, thanked him, and with a pleased smile
put it between the bouquet and the rosary. “I have
something else for you,” he continued, drawing the
little parcel from his pocket, and showing her the glittering
beads. “Oh, how can you spend so much money
for me!” she exclaimed, but her face beamed with
happy surprise and joy. “I should like to spend
everything I have for you,” he said with fervor.
“Please put it on now; it will be so becoming to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_818">[Pg 818]</span>
you!” She pushed everything that she was carrying
into his hands and then tried to fasten the ornament
around her neck, but did not succeed very well. “Let
me do it,” he said, and giving everything back to
her again he stepped behind her, gently pushed away
her braids, and fastened the clasp. “So, that is done!”
With a happy smile he looked at her. Then they
walked on, and soon reached the little chapel almost
hidden under some fine, old linden trees. Here were
only a few people worshiping; an old priest was officiating;
he read mass in a rather indifferent manner.
Tertschka knelt down in one of the last rows of seats,
set her flowers and the gingerbread heart in front of
her, and then folded her hands in prayer. George
remained standing behind her. A strange feeling crept
into his heart while in this quiet place, filled with a
soft light that fell through the high arched windows;
he heard the murmuring of the priest, the bell of the
sacristan; his heart bowed in worship, but he could
not say a prayer; he only looked steadily at Tertschka,
whose lips were moving. The service was
short; the priest spoke the blessing, and the worshipers
left. Only Tertschka did not move; the sexton
grew impatient and jingled his keys; at last she
rose, crossed herself, and went to the door, followed
by George. Golden sunlight greeted them outdoors,
and not far from the chapel a prosperous-looking
inn, with a great bunch of fir branches over the door,
seemed very inviting. “Are you going home directly,”
asked George as Tertschka was turning toward Schottwien
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_819">[Pg 819]</span></p>

<p>“Well, where else could we go?” she answered.</p>

<p>“Over there into the inn. I think we might allow
ourselves a treat to-day, Tertschka. Who knows when
we may have such a chance again!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you wish it! Only the foreman will bully
when I return so late. But you are right, we may
never again go out together.”</p>

<p>They walked toward the inn. In front of it, on a
small knoll, stood an old beech tree, spreading its
gigantic branches over a number of roughly hewn
tables and benches. No one was sitting there at the
time; everything was quiet; but in the house they
seemed very busy. At last the landlord appeared, in
snowy-white shirt sleeves, a small velvet cap on his
head. He glanced at his rather odd-looking guests;
but at George’s order he brought a large glass of wine,
bread, and meat, put it on the table where they were
sitting, asked for his money, and then hurried back
into the house. George pushed the plate toward Tertschka,
who cut the meat into small pieces; then they
divided the bread and began to eat, Tertschka using
the knife, George the fork, for they had been served
with one set only. The wine, too, they drank in turns
out of the same glass. When they had finished eating,
George lighted his pipe and contentedly watched
the blue ringlets of smoke as they curled into the
sunny air.</p>

<p>“Now, Tertschka,” he said at last, “we never
dreamed yesterday morning that so much pleasure
was in store for us; did we?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “I never expected that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_820">[Pg 820]</span></p>

<p>It was almost noontime. Suddenly there came the
sound of horns and clarinets from the distance. The
innkeeper came rushing out of the house, and called
to the servants: “Hurry up, the bridal party is coming,
and we have not yet set the tables.” His orders
were carried out instantly, and but just in time, for
the procession was already in sight, preceded by a
noisy crowd of boys and youths from the village. The
musicians marched at the head, then followed the bride
and groom, and behind them came all the relatives
and other invited guests, and, of course, a large crowd
of curious onlookers. In a moment the tables were
all occupied, and soon eating, drinking, and making
merry were in full swing, while the musicians played
with great spirit. With what strange sensations the
two watched all this gaiety. At first it was the crowd
that excited their curiosity, but afterward Tertschka
gave all her attention to the bride. She was very
handsome, indeed; probably the daughter of a rich
peasant. She wore a tight-fitting bodice of black velvet,
that showed off her fine figure to great advantage;
a chain of pure gold was wound five or six times about
her neck, and the myrtle wreath in her blond hair, that
fell in two heavy braids over her back, looked like a
crown over her proud and rather stern face. The
groom was very good looking too; quite contrary to
the usual fashion among peasants, he wore a slight
mustache, while his green felt hat, ornamented with
chamois-beard and eagle’s down, aroused George’s
envy. After a time, however, George and Tertschka
began to feel oppressed with a sense of loneliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_821">[Pg 821]</span>
among all these gay people, many of whom looked
askance at them, as if to ask: “What business have
you here?” Finally Tertschka turned to George:
“Let us go away; we don’t belong here! Come, let
us sit down near the edge of the woods; we can see
everything from there, and listen to the music too!”
They went toward the dark pine woods that covered
the hill on the other side of a sunny meadow; there
they sat down on the slope and listened to the cheerful
sound of the music, that drifted across the fields
to them in subdued strains. Suddenly it stopped; they
saw the people rising from their seats to form a half-circle;
then the violins began again. “Oh, the bride
and groom are dancing alone,” cried Tertschka.
And so it was. In measured time, circling gracefully,
the two slender figures danced on the greensward.</p>

<p>“How happy they seem!” Tertschka continued, unconsciously
leaning on George’s shoulder. “Just look
at them!”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are happy people,” he answered dreamily,
but without looking toward them. “When will
our wedding day come, Tertschka?”</p>

<p>“Oh, George!” she said faintly, and stooped to pick
a red flower that was growing near her.</p>

<p>“Resi”—it was the first time he called her so—“Resi,
if you only knew how I love you!” and, shy
and trembling, he put his arm around her.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but in her eyes, as she looked
at him, there lay a world of happiness. Fast and furious
came the sound of music from the inn, and the
bridal couple, intoxicated by the strains and by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_822">[Pg 822]</span>
shouting and clapping all about them, were dancing
themselves into a delirium. George drew the girl to
his heart, and their lips met in one long, passionate
kiss.</p>

<p>My intention is to tell you this simple story just as
it happened. Shall I try to describe the bliss that had
come into the life of those two people? I would rather
not attempt it. However, they had to conceal their
new-found happiness as if it were a sin; yet it glowed
in their souls all the warmer for that. With a humility
inborn and constantly developed by their hard life
they were content to greet each other with a stolen
smile or press their hands in secret whenever they met
in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. It seemed
almost as if the foreman had relaxed his watchfulness,
and they soon began to lose all fear of discovery, or
even of his suspecting their walk to Schottwien. Sometimes
as George came from the tracks to the quarry
with his wheelbarrow to get the crushed stones, he
would even dare to run up to Tertschka for a moment,
and then the lovers forgot the world in a quick
embrace and a kiss. One morning he had greeted her
in this way when they suddenly heard a footstep quite
close to them, and turning quickly in terror they saw
the foreman standing there, his face distorted with
fury.</p>

<p>“At last you are caught, you thieves!” he yelled.
“Is that the way to obey me? You thought I did not
notice what was going on, but I tell you I knew all
the time of your doings last Sunday, and only waited
to catch you in the act! I shall make you pay for all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_823">[Pg 823]</span>
this!” And he seized George by the back of the neck,
and with brutal force swung him to the ground some
distance away, where he fell among the stones. “Take
your stones down, you jailbird, then pack your belongings
and go! If you dare come near me again,
I will beat you till I break every bone in your body!”
With these words he ran shoving the man, already
stunned from the fall, headlong down the hill; then he
went back to Tertschka, and stared at her a long time
with fury and malice in his eyes. At last he hissed:
“You miserable wretch, you; I shall talk to you later!”
and, muttering to himself, went away.</p>

<p>Dazed, almost unconscious, George picked himself
up and went on to his place of work; mechanically he
emptied the wheelbarrow; then he sat down on a stone
and stared into space, unable to think. The clouds
that had covered the sky early in the morning had become
darker and heavier; a cold autumn wind blew
through the trees and a penetrating rain began to
fall. George did not feel the drops that beat into his
face; sparks of fire danced before his eyes and hot and
cold shudders shook him from head to foot. Gradually
a realization of the insult to himself mingled
with the burning sense of the injustice that was being
done to both him and Tertschka. He was to be driven
away from one who belonged to him by right of sacred
bond! who had a right to do that? No one! And the
longer he thought of it, the more his timid, long suffering
heart rebelled, and a wonderful strength, a holy
courage, began to kindle in him, ready to face and fight
any power on earth that dared to take his loved one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_824">[Pg 824]</span>
from him. His insignificant features took on an expression
of firm resolve, and his eyes shone with a
strange fire. At last he arose and walked up to the
place where he knew he would find Tertschka; the
others looked at him in wonder. The girl sat and
wept. “Do not cry, Resi,” he said; and there was a
new and strong ring in his voice.</p>

<p>She did not answer. He gently lifted her head, but
she only began to weep the more passionately.</p>

<p>“Do not cry,” he repeated, “It had to be, I suppose.
But it is all right, and we know now what
to do.”</p>

<p>She looked straight before her.</p>

<p>“He has sent me away—and you will go with me!”</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him.</p>

<p>“Down there, somewhere in Carniola, they are
building a railway; we can easily find work there.”</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“You won’t, Resi? And see, one more thing. I
have been told that soldiers who have served their time
and have gone through the war may claim a position
as watchman on a railway track. I shall send in a
petition, and perhaps if I succeed we shall have one
of those little houses by the tracks and live in it as
husband and wife. And even if that should fail,” he
added quickly—for she had not yet given a sign of
consent, only kept on weeping more than ever—“well,
then, we shall have to submit and work hard for a few
years and save as much as possible. But just say one
word, Resi!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she moaned, “what you say is all beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_825">[Pg 825]</span>
and right, but you forget that the man will never let
me go!”</p>

<p>“He <em>must</em> let you go. You are no longer a child.
You don’t belong to him. You are a laborer here, like
all the rest of them, and can go when and wherever
you please!”</p>

<p>“Believe me, George, he will <em>not</em> let me go; never,
and certainly not with <em>you</em>. I have not spoken about
it before”—the red blood colored her face deeply—“but
I must tell you now. Even when my mother
was still living, he pursued me with his hateful
caresses; I threatened to tell my mother, and he kept
away for a time. But last summer he left the others
at the inn one evening and came home alone; he tried
to make love to me and promised to marry me. But
I told him what I thought of him, and now he hates
me and tries to get his revenge wherever he can.”</p>

<p>George grew pale to the lips and the breath struggled
in his breast. “The scoundrel!” he panted. “And
to think of your staying here with him! Never! You
go with me, and I would like to know how he can prevent
it!”</p>

<p>“George, beware of him! He is capable of murdering
any one weaker than himself!”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of him.” And George drew up his
slight figure until he looked like a different man. “He
attacked me from behind and unawares; but now I
shall be on my guard. Let us go to him, and quietly
and firmly tell him of our resolution. You will see
how he gives in; for, wicked as he may be, he <em>must</em>
see that he has neither right nor power to keep you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_826">[Pg 826]</span></p>

<p>She wrung her hands in despair.</p>

<p>“Resi, take courage!” he said very earnestly. “Will
you let me go alone?” She flew to him and clasped
her hands around his neck.</p>

<p>“Well, then”—and he gently stroked her hair—“let
us go!” Together they slowly walked toward the
house; she with a heart full of anguish and fear of
what she knew was about to happen; he full of confidence
and indomitable courage. As they crossed the
threshold, they saw the foreman sitting at the table
peeling potatoes. He looked almost startled, seeing
them enter together, but soon his surprise changed to
anger and fury.</p>

<p>“What do you want here, you two?” he cried, half
rising and grasping the knife firmly, as if for battle.</p>

<p>“You discharged me,” George answered coolly, “and
I am come to get my things and to tell you that Tertschka
goes with me.”</p>

<p>The foreman made a motion as if to throw himself
upon George, but involuntarily drew back again before
the quiet, determined face of the latter.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say to such talk,” he growled.</p>

<p>“You need not say anything,” said George. “Tertschka
is free to come and go as she pleases.” The
foreman laughed. George continued: “Now take what
belongs to you, Resi,” and, turning to look for his
own knapsack, “then let us go.”</p>

<p>The heart of the other man labored heavily. For a
moment he evidently did not know what to do. Irresolutely
he looked at Tertschka, who could not conceal
her fear, then quick as a flash as she was going toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_827">[Pg 827]</span>
her trunk he rushed at her and pushed her down
into the cellar through the half-open door. He locked
it and put the key into his pocket. “There, that is my
answer,” he stuttered, trembling all over with excitement,
while he sat down at the table again, pretending
to go on with his work.</p>

<p>This had all happened so quickly, so unexpectedly,
that George did not have time to prevent it. But he
controlled himself at once, and without a sign of
haste, strapping the knapsack to his back, he walked
leisurely toward the table where the man sat. “Let
Tertschka out of the cellar!”</p>

<p>The hands of the foreman shook. And as George
repeated his demand for the third time, vehemently,
the man sprang up and clenched his fist. “Go at once—go!”
he cried, “or—”</p>

<p>“Or what?” asked George calmly. “I am not afraid
of you, though you are stronger than I am. It was
easy enough to knock me down before, for I was then
as defenseless as Tertschka is now, but now we stand
face to face.”</p>

<p>The man’s color grew livid; hate, revengefulness,
cowardice, struggled in his face. His fury almost
choked him, and his hands shook as he stretched them
out to seize something, he knew not what. George
noticed all this, and his courage grew in consequence.
“I advise you to give up freely what is mine,” he said,
“or I will take it by force.”</p>

<p>At that moment some of the men entered; it was
almost noon. Instinct had probably told them that
something unusual was going on, and they did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_828">[Pg 828]</span>
wish to miss it. Their presence had a stimulating
effect upon the furious man; he felt safer, and his
cowardice, of which he was well aware, now grew to
temerity, by reason of this very fear of detection.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he cried, addressing the men;
“this miserable fellow dares to threaten me because I
locked Tertschka in so that she could not run away
with him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t insult us,” cried George, whose blood was
mounting in spite of himself. “We are two honest
people. You have no right to lock up Tertschka!”</p>

<p>“What? I have no right? Why, the girl was
brought up by me!”</p>

<p>“God have pity on her if she was brought up by you!
I shall say no more; I will spare you before all these
people!” And with that he pointed toward the men,
who were watching the growing quarrel with a kind
of dull pleasure.</p>

<p>“Listen to the dog! He will spare me, will he!
Seize him and throw him out!” The men looked at
each other irresolutely, but they did not move. Behind
the cellar door there was an audible moaning.</p>

<p>“Do you see?” continued George with rising excitement,
“no one thinks of laying hands on me. For the
last time I tell you, set Tertschka free—or I will take
the hammer to it.”</p>

<p>“Out, you thief! or I will send for the police!”</p>

<p>“Let them come,” cried George, in a passion. “Then
we shall see who is in the right. They will find out
why you locked Tertschka in; how you maltreated the
poor girl for years, made her life miserable with your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_829">[Pg 829]</span>
shameful proposals, and took away her hard-earned
wages as well as the money her mother left to her—to
say nothing of that poor woman’s death, which is
on your conscience, too! And they will also discover
how you treat the poor, defenseless workmen here,
how you grow fat on the sweat and blood of their
labor—!” George stopped. The weight and truth
of these accusations filled the foreman’s cup to overflowing,
and he completely lost all self-control. His
face took on the color of death, foam stood on his
lips, his eyes started almost out of his head, and with
a cry that might have come from a wounded steer he
threw himself upon George with knife swinging in air.
The latter had seized the hammer, and now brought it
down with a thud upon the other’s breast. The foreman
swayed and fell moaning to the ground, the dark
blood streaming from his mouth. For a moment there
was silence; a mute, desolate horror held all present.
George stood there like David by the body of Goliath.</p>

<p>“Resi, Resi!” he called suddenly, breaking open the
cellar door with a few sharp blows. “You are free!”</p>

<p>“Jesu Maria!” she cried, hastening out and beating
her hands together as she gazed at the dead man. “He
is dead! Oh, George! George! They will take you
to prison now and convict you for murder!”</p>

<p>“Let them; I will answer them. These people here
will bear me witness that he attacked me with a knife.
Go down,” addressing the men, “and tell them that the
laborer George Huber has killed the foreman.”</p>

<p>It was some time before any one could make up his
mind to go. George sat down with Tertschka in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_830">[Pg 830]</span>
of the house; she wept constantly. Sometimes he
gently stroked her face. At last two gentlemen from
the railway offices appeared and a policeman. “We
will have to give him up to the authorities,” said the
policeman. “He is a soldier on furlough.”</p>

<p>The policeman tried to comfort poor, heartbroken
Tertschka, telling her that the affair would not look
very black for the prisoner if the facts were reported
correctly. He even allowed her to sit at his side in
the post-chaise in which they were to take George to
Wiener-Neustadt. So they rode out into the night, while
the rain fell in torrents, and the dead man, whom they
had left behind, was taken to his last resting-place.</p>

<p>A military prison is a prison just like any other,
with the exception that those who find themselves in
it carry old, tattered uniforms on their backs. One
finds there soldiers of every rank and color, and as
these all feel themselves members of one profession,
so more peace and harmony rules among them than is
apt to be the case elsewhere, especially since the maintenance
of the various differences in rank results in a
certain kind of order and discipline. However, a
prison is, and always will be, a sad, gloomy place, and
it is not to be wondered at that George did not feel
easy at heart when he arrived there on that dark night.
A cross-looking turnkey had locked him into a room
already overcrowded and in complete darkness. There
was no straw mattress ready for him, so he stretched
himself out on the bare wooden floor. All about him
were men sleeping, but he could not sleep. During the
long, sad drive from the station his buoyant courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_831">[Pg 831]</span>
had begun to fail, and now doubt and worry crept into
his heart. And when the morning dawned, and its pale
light fell on the bare, dirty walls and unpleasant faces
of his fellow prisoners, the seriousness of his situation
oppressed him more and more. Not that he feared so
much the result of his deed—he did not repent, he had
been attacked and had only defended his life—but he
saw the dead man before him, saw him lying in his
blood, pale and stiff; and his warm heart, so full of
sympathy for others, felt pity even for that man, and
regretted sorely that all this had to come about. Unfortunately
days and weeks passed without a summons
to the court-room, without any indication of an
investigation or trial. Added to this worry about his
own future was a great anxiety with regard to Tertschka,
of whose fate he knew nothing whatever, and
whose companionship he missed sadly. Through the
efforts of the honest policeman the poor girl had found
lodgings and even work among the masons on some
new building. No one who saw her carrying buckets
filled with brick or mortar would have guessed that
her heart was nearly breaking with sorrow and grief.
In the evening, when work was finished, or on Sundays
and holidays, she wandered about that part of
the barracks where the prison stood, and looked up
to the barred and shuttered windows, trying to catch
a glimpse of George’s face somewhere. Several times
she had been scolded by a sentry and driven away. In
her distress she finally appealed to the guard at the
gate, and begged him to tell her where George Huber
was; she wanted to speak to him. They only laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_832">[Pg 832]</span>
and jeered at her. One day an amiable-looking non-commissioned
officer took pity on her and promised
to find out where the prisoner was lodged and tell him
of her wish. She herself was not allowed to speak to
him without permission from the judge-advocate. It
would be well for her to see that gentleman, but she
must do so early in the morning; during the day he
could never be found at home. The very next Sunday,
then, Tertschka dressed herself in her woolen jacket
and calico skirt and went early in the morning to the
judge-advocate’s house, which the officer had pointed
out to her. She had to wait in the hall a long time,
for the gentleman was still asleep, so she was told. At
last he came from his room, dressed to go out, and
asked hurriedly what she wished. He scarcely listened
to what she had to say, told her that permission to see
prisoners could be given only in very rare cases; but
she need not worry, the whole affair would soon come
to a close. She went away without much comfort.
Again week after week went by and no progress in
poor George’s affair. To tell the truth, the judge was
a gay young man, more interested in the beautiful
ladies of the town than in his legal documents, and
anything that concerned soldiers on furlough he particularly
liked to put off as long as possible. Tertschka’s
heart filled with ever-increasing anxiety; she
spoke again to the amiable man who had advised her
before. He considered there was nothing left for her
to do but to see the Colonel of the barracks. To be
sure, he was a very grave, stern man, yet he was
always ready to help others. She decided to follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_833">[Pg 833]</span>
the officer’s advice again, and went to see the commandant.
There, too, she had to wait a long time, yet
not in the hall, but in a warm room. As it was a cold
winter’s day, she felt grateful for this. In the next
room she heard the click of sabres; some officers then
stepped out and went away, looking somewhat depressed,
as she thought. After a while the door
opened again. A fine-looking man with a slightly
gray mustache looked out, and asked in a gruff tone
what she wanted. She was frightened and began to
cry; then his manner changed, and he asked her kindly
to come in and sit down. He listened in silence to
her petition. After she had finished, he questioned
her a little and made her tell the whole story. She
did so in a very simple, often awkward, manner; but
her warm, true heart spoke out of every word so
frankly that the Colonel seemed deeply touched.
Finally he laid his hand very gently on her shoulder
and told her to be of good cheer; he gave his word
of honor that the matter should be attended to immediately.
With a load lifted from her heart she left him.
The Colonel, however, walked up and down in his
room, deep in thought, clicking his spurs together
from time to time. At last he called an orderly and
sent him with a message to the judge-advocate. He
had to wait a long time before that young gentleman
appeared, looking quite flushed and bowing low.</p>

<p>“I have been told,” began the Colonel, “that about
four months ago a soldier on furlough—his name is
George Huber—was brought here for court-martial.”</p>

<p>The judge put his hand to his brow, as if to reflect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_834">[Pg 834]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, George Huber!—a case of manslaughter.”</p>

<p>“I wish to have the trial brought to a speedy end.”</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” the other one said, evidently quite
relieved. “It is a very ordinary story. We let the man
run the gantlet a few times, and the matter is settled.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” answered the Colonel, “that would
be a very superficial and arbitrary mode of procedure.
And I am most anxious to see this case handled
with the greatest care. Allow me to remark—with
all respect for your judicial knowledge and experience—that
there are very exceptional circumstances
involved in this case; I have convinced myself of that.”
The Colonel drew his eyebrows close together at these
words; the judge knew what that meant, bowed in
silence and departed. He went straightway to his
office, and, as he did not lack ability and quick insight,
had the matter soon sifted, examined the witnesses,
Tertschka among them, and the court-martial pronounced
the following sentence: George Huber, soldier
on furlough, of the Twelfth Regiment, is guilty
of manslaughter and sentenced to one year of hard
labor. Considering that there were extenuating circumstances,
also that his conduct during the time of
service in the army has been irreproachable, the long
term of imprisonment while awaiting trial is considered
punishment enough.</p>

<p>The young judge’s face flushed a little; but it flushed
even more when he took the sentence to the Colonel for
approval, and the Colonel, after reading the paper,
said with a smile: “Now and then even negligence of
duty may bring about good results.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_835">[Pg 835]</span></p>

<p>Two days later the Colonel sent for George and
Tertschka. He looked at them long and silently, asked
a few questions, and advised them to stay in town for
the present. He would see that they found work
enough to earn a living; later on they would hear
from him again. After they had gone, the Colonel
again walked up and down the room, as he had done
the day before, clicking his spurs together from time to
time. Strange thoughts were passing through his mind.
Many years ago he had been deeply in love with a beautiful,
fair woman, and had been very unhappy. Not that
the lady rejected his love—such a disappointment his
proud, young heart could have overcome—but he had
been cruelly deceived in his most sacred feelings; and
that had filled him with a lasting bitterness and an
unnatural contempt for the whole sex, a contempt
which he very plainly liked to show. He was anxious
for the world to know that he did not believe in love,
and now, after so long and passionately upholding this
opinion in opposition to a gentle voice in his inmost
heart, these two poor, half-starved people were proving
to him the real existence of love, love in all its depths,
devotion and tenderness, in its holiness and strength!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Over there, where the grizzly railroad tracks wind
in and out along the banks of the rushing Mur, past
green meadows and fertile fields, not far from the
Castle of Ehrenhausen, which looks down from its
wooded height on the town of the same name, stands
a lonely little house, belonging to one of the watchmen
of the railway. Back of the house is a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_836">[Pg 836]</span>
piece of land, planted with corn and vegetables, while
in front there is a little flower garden, where mallows
and sunflowers bloom, fenced in by a hedge of beans.
In this house, whose peaceful charm delights all travelers,
George and Tertschka have been living now as
man and wife for more than fifteen years. It is
scarcely necessary to say that the stern colonel assisted
in settling them there. The couple look little
older than they did when we first met them. Though
dividing the duties of a very responsible service, they
still find time and opportunity to take care of their
little piece of land, of a goat, and several chickens,
and to bring up two flaxen-haired children, latecomers,
but very welcome, who sprout up merrily
behind the bean hedge. Sometimes they have a quiet
hour to themselves, when they sit down, hand in hand,
on the bench before the door, and, looking out toward
the setting sun, remember gladly the day when they
first met on the heights of the Semmering. Again
they live through the sorrows and joys of the past to
the moment, the terrible moment, when a cruel fate
seemed to be crushing them forever, which yet has
led them at last to this peace and happiness. And if
across the path of their memories a dark shadow still
lingers, they call their children, that come nestling so
close to their hearts and look out with their big eyes
so innocently into the world as if there were never a
strange and changeable fate pursuing man from generation
to generation as long as he finds breath on
this old earth.</p>

<p>Countess Mara Barovic was the Circe,
Omphale, and Semiramis of the mountainous
part of Croatia.</p>

<p>Old and young (men, be it understood) were at her
feet; and this despite the fact that she was regarded
as plain-looking rather than pretty. Her ugliness,
however, was the sort that strikes attention, attracts
consideration, and excites interest. Moreover, she
boasted a “past” that cast a halo about the present.</p>

<p>It was rumored that one of her lovers had “accidentally”
shot her husband while out hunting, and
that this accident had occurred at a time when the
Count had become “embarrassing.”</p>

<p>Besides, she was original.</p>

<p>If it be true that woman is a work of art, as a celebrated
poet has said, it must be borne in mind that in
these days the agreeable and pleasing in art is no
longer “the thing.” Cruel, unadorned truth is preferred
to draped loveliness, in love as well as in art.</p>

<p>The Countess belonged to the type demanded by
the modern school. By her two most ardent admirers,
Baron Kronenfels and Mr. De Broda, she was termed
respectively the iconoclast and the naturalist.</p>

<p>She mounted her horse like a hussar, was a dashing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_840">[Pg 840]</span>whip, and indulged a passionate fondness for hunting.
One of her favorite pastimes was roaming field and
forest in the picturesque costume of the Croatian peasant;
and she could apply the horsewhip as dexterously
and mercilessly to her creditors as to her refractory
horses.</p>

<p>The fair lady was head over ears in debt. There
was nothing she could longer call her own, not even
the furniture in Chateau Granic, not even the false
braid which adorned her well-poised little head.</p>

<p>The young aristocrats who danced attendance upon
her ladyship explained the preference displayed by
this Croatian Circe for the “wise men of the East”—as
they called Kronenfels and De Broda—by the brilliant
financial position of her two Jewish admirers.</p>

<p>Of the two, Baron Kronenfels’s noble birth rested
upon the more ancient foundation, and for that reason,
perhaps, he enjoyed a certain priority in the fair
lady’s preference. De Broda was a mere sapling in
the forest of aristocracy, having been but recently ennobled.
The unfeigned adoration he displayed for his
armorial bearings made him the butt of endless practical
jokes. His coat-of-arms glittered wherever it
could find a resting-place. It shone upon the collar
of his dog; it was emblazoned on his cigarettes, made
especially for him at Laferme’s.</p>

<p>Despite certain differences of taste, Kronenfels and
De Broda were good friends, good comrades as well,
for they were both officers in the Reserve. But how
often does friendship stand its ground against the
whispers of jealousy, especially when a woman’s favor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_841">[Pg 841]</span>
is the prize at stake? The relationship between the
two grew strained and unnatural, and they were both
secretly conscious that they were walking along a path
where the least deviation from the centre would result
in a catastrophe.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The long-looked-for altercation took place one evening
at the club. Wine had been flowing freely, the
betting had been high. Countess Mara was the subject
under discussion, and Baron Roukavina was telling
an amusing story in that lady’s eventful life.</p>

<p>She had not paid her taxes for years, was threatened
with an execution, and had been moving heaven
and earth to avert the impending disgrace. She had
gone to Agram, from there to Buda-Pesth, importuning
ministers, seeking favor with deputies, and had
actually got so far as to ask an audience of the king.
She had received hopeful promises everywhere, but
the danger hung heavier over her head with the passing
of every hour.</p>

<p>At this particular juncture, Baron Meyerbach called
on her, and offered to settle her troubles. Meyerbach
was an intelligent fellow, with a good heart, and a
purse with the proverbial open mouth; but Hungarian
aristocracy could not receive him within its inner circle
for the simple reason that he was a Jew.</p>

<p>“Have you so much influence?” asked the Countess.
Her breath was almost taken away by the offer.</p>

<p>“Do not inquire too closely into my <em>modus operandi</em>,
Countess,” said the Baron. “It must be sufficient
for you to know that my success is assured.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_842">[Pg 842]</span></p>

<p>“And what do you ask in exchange for this service?”</p>

<p>“Simply this: that for the next two weeks you will
take a walk with me every day for an hour in Vaitzen
Street; that you will skate with me an hour in the
park; and that each evening you will give me the
privilege of escorting you to a different theatre.”</p>

<p>“And is that all?”</p>

<p>“All.”</p>

<p>The Countess yielded willingly to the Baron’s terms.
At the end of the fortnight, she received a receipt in
full for the payment of her taxes—thirty-two thousand
florins—and Baron Meyerbach found Hungarian
aristocracy ready to receive him with open arms even
within its most inner of inner circles. The Countess
had launched him.</p>

<p>The story closed in a burst of laughter, and the diplomat
Meyerbach’s health was drunk repeatedly and
variously.</p>

<p>Of all the convivial party, De Broda alone was silent.
Finally, with Goethe’s words in mind, he said in a low
voice: “Everybody seeks money, and everybody clings
to it.”</p>

<p>Kronenfels flung his cards noisily on the table,
looked savagely at De Broda, and said, with an ugly
frown: “Do you imply by that that such a woman as
Countess Mara Barovic would willingly let herself be
blinded by money?”</p>

<p>De Broda shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Springing from his seat, the Baron cried out, scornfully:
“You are a Jew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_843">[Pg 843]</span></p>

<p>For a moment, participants and listeners seemed
paralyzed with astonishment; then De Broda, every
nerve tingling with rage, hurled angrily back at his
assailant: “You are another!”</p>

<p>A challenge to a duel was the result of the quarrel.
Seconds were chosen on the spot, the weapons were
to be pistols, and the oak forest near De Granic was to
witness the affair early the following morning.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>De Broda had gone home. He was arranging his
papers in order, when Rabbi Solomon Zuckermandel
walked into his sanctum.</p>

<p>“You are going to fight?” were the old man’s first
words.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And with a Jew? No, Mr. De Broda; you can not,
you dare not shoot a man! You will not do it.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Rabbi Solomon, but my knowledge is
somewhat deeper than yours in affairs of honor.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so!” replied the old man, with an
indulgent smile. “Ah, well, we shall see. You think
we can wash our honor only in blood? My dear Mr.
De Broda, spotless honor needs no washing; and if it
has a blemish, it can not be effaced even by blood.
The Baron called you a Jew. Is that an insult?”</p>

<p>“In the sense he attached to the word, yes.”</p>

<p>“Not so. Neither in that sense nor in any other.
Does the name of soldier become an insult because soldiers
have deserted their flag? The Jews we call to
mind when the word ‘Jew’ is used in reproach are
those who have forsaken their standard. They are no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_844">[Pg 844]</span>
longer Jews. Judaism is the fear of the Lord, love
of liberty, love of the family and humanity. The honor
of the Jew consists not in spilling blood, but in acting
uprightly and doing good.”</p>

<p>“You are right; but—”</p>

<p>“No, no. No ‘buts.’ When God in the midst of
thunder and lightning gave the Tables of the Law to
Moses on Mount Sinai, there were no ‘buts’; He said:
‘<em>Thou shalt not kill!</em>’ You are a Jew, Mr. De Broda.
In other words: Man, thou shalt not kill!”</p>

<p>The young fellow turned toward the window. The
rabbi should not see his emotion. But the Jewish
heart was touched, and the old man who gave no
thought to title and coat-of-arms had conquered the
aristocrat’s pride and prejudice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Midnight had struck when Rabbi Solomon reached
Kronenfels’s quarters. The letter he handed the
Baron from his adversary read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—You have insulted me grossly in calling
me a Jew in the presence of a number of gentlemen,
and have added to the insult, as it were, by making
it at a time when Mr. De Treitschke in Berlin has
spoken of the Jews as the schlamassl [the plague of
the Germans]. You are, however, an only son, the
pride of your family, and I should like to avoid our
meeting for to-morrow. You have often seen me hit
the ace at a good range; and you know as well that
I am no phrase-maker. I propose, therefore, that we
shall both shoot in the air, and that we shall mutually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_845">[Pg 845]</span>
exchange our word of honor not to speak of this
arrangement.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">“Broda.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Kronenfels held the letter to the rabbi.</p>

<p>“What is to be done?” he asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Mr. De Broda has proved himself a true Jew,”
responded Zuckermandel, gently. “Do not let him
surpass you. Prove to him that you, too, are of a
race which, boasting the most ancient civilization, is
above all others from the humanitarian standpoint.”</p>

<p>Kronenfels wrote some hurried lines which Rabbi
Solomon conveyed to Mr. De Broda before daybreak.
The Baron’s answer was couched in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I was about to address you when I received
your note.</p>

<p>“I, too, should deeply regret having a mortal encounter
with a young man upon whom so many hopes
are placed.</p>

<p>“I accept your proposition.</p>

<p>“Moreover, between ourselves be it said, we are
Jews—in other words, descendants of ancestors whose
house is more ancient than that of the Lichtensteins
or Auerspergs, ancestors who have transmitted to us
two qualities which Mr. De Treitschke could scarcely
possess, being as it were the offshoot of a somewhat
recent civilization: and these are, repugnance to shed
blood, and the ‘rachmonni’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the Jewish heart.</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Kronenfels</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_846">[Pg 846]</span></p>
<p>The duel took place at six o’clock in the morning,
the venerable oaks of De Granic forest casting an air
of solemnity over the bloodless scene. The adversaries
kept their word; the pistols were discharged in
the air; and the witnesses declared that honorable satisfaction
had been made. As De Broda and Kronenfels
were shaking hands with hearty good-will, the
brushwood parted, and old Rabbi Solomon slowly approached
the young men. Raising his arms in benediction,
he said, and the light of happiness beamed
from his eyes: “Gentlemen, you are Jews!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class="center big1">BY RUDOLF BAUMBACH</p>



<p class="center p2b">Translated by Minnie B. Hudson.<br>

<p>It was on the day of the summer solstice, and the
glow of midday lay on the corn-fields. At times
a fresh wind swept over from the mountain forest
near; then the stalks bent low, and the poppies on
the edge of the field scattered their delicate petals.
Crickets and grasshoppers chirped in the grain, and
from the blackthorn on the roadside the goldhammer
once in a while let her gentle call be heard.</p>

<p>Through the corn-field, which extended from the
valley to the mountain, walked, in the narrow path, a
young woman of slender yet strong figure. She wore
the customary plaited skirt, and, for protection against
the sun’s rays, a red kerchief; on her left arm hung a
basket, and in her right hand she carried a stone jug.</p>

<p>As the goldhammer in the thorn-hedge became aware
of her presence he fluttered to the highest twig and
called softly: “Maiden, maiden, how do you flourish?”
But the bird was mistaken. The blond Greta was no
maiden, but a young wife, and now was on her way to
her husband, who felled wood in the forest above.</p>

<p>When the fair one had reached the border of the forest
she stood listening, and soon the strokes of a woodman’s
ax told her where to turn her steps. It was not
long before she saw her husband, who felled a pine tree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_850">[Pg 850]</span>with mighty strokes, and, with joyful voice, she called
to him.</p>

<p>“Remain standing where thou art,” responded he.
“The tree will fall directly.” And the pine tree gave a
deep sigh, bowed itself, and sank crashing to the earth.</p>

<p>Now Greta came nearer, and the sunburnt woodcutter
took his young wife in his arms and kissed her
fondly. Then she sat down on the trunk of the tree,
and took the food from the basket she had brought.
Here Hans laid down the bread from his hand, took
his ax, and said: “I have forgotten something,” stepped
in the direction of the fallen pine, and cut three crosses
in the wood.</p>

<p>“Why dost thou that, Hans?” asked the wife.</p>

<p>“That was done on account of the wood-sprites,”
explained the husband. “The poor creatures have a
wicked enemy, who is the wild hunter. Day and night
he waylays them and hunts them with his dogs.
But if the pursued little women succeed in escaping
to such a tree-trunk, then the wild huntsman can not
harm them, because of the three crosses.”</p>

<p>The young wife’s eyes grew large. “Hast thou ever
met a wood-sprite?” asked she, curious.</p>

<p>“No. They only rarely let themselves be seen. But
to-day is the solstice, when they become visible.” And
suddenly he called with a loud voice into the forest:
“Wood-sprite, appear!”</p>

<p>He had only done this in order to tease his wife; but,
on the holy midsummer day, one should not jest about
such things.</p>

<p>At once a little woman, a yard high, delicate of form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_851">[Pg 851]</span>
and very beautiful of face, stood before the pair. She
wore a long white garment, and in her golden hair a
spray of mistletoe.</p>

<p>Hans and Greta were very much frightened. They
rose up hastily from their seats, and Greta made a
bow, the best she could do.</p>

<p>“You have called me at a good time,” said the wood-sprite,
and pointed with forefinger to the orb of the
sun, that stood almost over her head, “and a good
deed”—here the little woman pointed to the marked
tree-stump—“is the other reason. Gold and silver have
I not to give away, but I know of something better.
Come with me; it will do you no harm, and take your
jug: you will be able to make use of it.”</p>

<p>So she spoke and led the way. Hans shouldered his
woodman’s ax, Greta took up the stone jug, and both
followed the little woman. She had a walk like a duck,
and Greta plucked her husband’s sleeve, pointed to the
waddling little woman, and would have whispered
something into his ear, but Hans laid his forefinger on
her mouth. Nothing hurts a sprite more than to have
a person ridicule their gait. They have feet like a
duck, and therefore they wear long, flowing garments
to hide them.</p>

<p>After a short time the three arrived at a clearing.
Very old trees stood in a circle around the meadow;
out of the grass arose lilies and bluebells, and great
butterflies rested thereon, waving their wings to and
fro. And Hans, who thought he knew the whole forest,
could not remember to have ever crossed this place.</p>

<p>On the edge of the meadow stood a small house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_852">[Pg 852]</span>
The walls were covered with the bark of trees, and the
roof was shingled with the scales of pine cones, and
each scale was fastened down by a rose-thorn. Here
the wood-sprite was at home.</p>

<p>She led her guests behind the house, and pointed
to a spring whose water gushed silently from the
black earth. Succulent coltsfoot and irises grew on its
brink, and over its surface danced green and gold
dragon-flies.</p>

<p>“That is the fountain of youth,” said the wood-sprite.
“A bath in its water turns an old man into a
boy and an old woman into a girl. But if one drinks
the water then does it ward off old age until death.
Fill your jug and carry it home. But be economical
with this precious water; a drop on each Sunday is
enough to keep you young. And yet again: As soon
as thou, Hans, dost cast thy eye on a strange woman,
or thou, Greta, on a strange man, then the water loses
its virtue. That mark you. Now fill your jug and fare
you well.”</p>

<p>So spoke the wood-sprite, refusing the thanks of the
lucky couple, and went into the house. Greta filled the
jug with the water of youth, and then they hastened
home as quickly as they could to their cottage.</p>

<p>Arrived at home, Hans poured the water into a bottle
and sealed it with fir resin. “For the present,” he
remarked, “we do not find the water of youth necessary,
and we can economize. The time will come, indeed,
when we will need it.” And then they placed the
bottle in the cupboard where they kept their treasures:
a couple of old coins, a garnet chain on which hung a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_853">[Pg 853]</span>
golden penny, and two silver spoons. But Greta took
great care that the water lost not its virtue.</p>

<p>And how they did take themselves in hand! When
the young forester went by the garden before the house
and exchanged a greeting with Greta, as indeed had
been his custom, then Greta looked not up from her
vegetable-bed. And when Hans sat in the evening in
“The White Stag,” and the pretty Lisi brought him
wine, then he made a face like a cat during a storm;
and finally he did not go any more to the inn, but remained
at home with his wife. Thus the water must
certainly retain its magic power.</p>

<p>So there passed for the young couple a year of love
and happiness, when to the two came a third. In the
cradle a chubby boy kicked and cried, so that the
father’s heart leaped for joy. “Now,” thought he,
“is the time come for us to open the bottle. What
thinkest thou, Greta? A drop of the water of youth
would do thee good.”</p>

<p>The wife agreed to the proposition, and Hans went
into the room where the magic potion was preserved.
With hands trembling with joy he loosed the cork and—Oh,
wo, wo!—the bottle slipped from his hands, and
the water of youth poured over the floor. He came
near falling to the floor, he was so frightened over the
misfortune. What was he to do now? His wife must
on no account learn what had happened; she might die
from fright.</p>

<p>Perhaps he could tell her later what he had done;
perhaps, also, he might find the fountain of youth again
(which he had certainly sought in vain), and he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_854">[Pg 854]</span>
replace the loss. He hastily filled a new bottle, which
was just like the first, with well-water, and well-water
it was also that he gave his wife.</p>

<p>“Ah, how it refreshes and strengthens one!” said
Greta; “take a drop also, dear Hans.”</p>

<p>And Hans obeyed and praised the virtue of the magic
potion, and from that time each one took a drop every
Sunday when the church-bell was ringing. And Greta
bloomed like a rose, and Hans’s veins swelled with
health and strength. But he postponed the confession
of his deed from day to day, for he hoped in his heart
to yet find the water of youth; but roam through the
forest as he would he could not discover the meadow
where the wood-sprite lived.</p>

<p>Thus passed some years. A small maiden joined the
little boy, and Frau Greta’s once round chin had become
double. She herself certainly saw it not, for the
mirror was not yet in existence in those days. Hans
saw it, indeed, but avoided speaking of it, and redoubled
his love for his portly wife.</p>

<p>Then there happened a misfortune. At least Greta
held it to be such. As she swept the house one day the
small Peter, her eldest, came upon the cupboard in
which stood the bottle with the supposed water of youth
and clumsily overthrew the bottle, so that it broke and
the contents were spilled.</p>

<p>“Oh, thou gracious Heaven!” lamented the mother.
“It is lucky, though, that Hans is not at home.” With
trembling hands she gathered up the fragments from
the floor and replaced the bottle by another, which she
filled with ordinary water. “Certainly the deception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_855">[Pg 855]</span>
will soon be found out, for now is it all over with the
everlasting youth. Alas, alas!” But for the present
she did not wish to tell her husband anything
about it.</p>

<p>Again considerable time passed, and the couple lived
together as on the day when the priest had joined their
hands in marriage.</p>

<p>Each one carefully avoided letting the other know
that youth was past, and each Sunday conscientiously
took the magic drop.</p>

<p>Then it happened that one morning a gray hair remained
between Hans’s fingers as he combed his hair.
And he thought: “Now is the time for me to tell the
truth to my wife.” With a heavy heart, he began:
“Greta, it seems to me that our water of youth has lost
its strength. Look there! I have found a gray hair.
I am getting old.”</p>

<p>Greta was frightened, but composed herself, and,
forcing a loud laugh, cried: “A gray hair! When I
was a little girl, ten years old, I had even then a gray
lock amid my hair. The like has frequently happened.
Thou hast lately dressed a badger; perhaps something
has happened to your hair from the fat, for badger’s
fat, you know, colors the hair gray. No, dear Hans,
the water has not lost its old virtue, or”—here she cast
an anxious glance on him—“or perhaps thou also findest
that I am growing old?”</p>

<p>Now Hans laughed very loudly. “Thou, old! Thou
bloomest, indeed, like a peony!” And then he threw
his arms about her and gave her a kiss. But when he
was alone he said, with quiet thankfulness: “God be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_856">[Pg 856]</span>
thanked! She knows not that we are getting old.
Now it matters not.”</p>

<p>And similarly thought the wife.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day the young folks of
the village danced to the fiddle of a wandering musician,
and no couple wheeled more merrily under the
linden than Hans and Greta.</p>

<p>The peasant women made sarcastic remarks, to be
sure; but the two heard nothing of the ridicule in their
happiness.</p>

<p>After that it happened in the fall, as Hans with his
family was eating a Martinmas goose, that Frau Greta
broke a tooth. There was great lamenting, for she was
so proud of her white teeth.</p>

<p>And when the couple were alone together the wife
said, in an unsteady voice: “This misfortune would
not have occurred if the water—”</p>

<p>But at this Hans blurted out: “You think the water
is good for everything. Has it not often happened
before that a child has broken out a tooth by cracking
a nut? What hast thou against the excellent water?
Art thou not fresh and sound as a rose? Or perhaps
thou hast turned thine eyes upon another that thou
mistrustest the virtue of the water?”</p>

<p>Then the wife laughed, wiped the tears from her
cheeks, and kissed her husband so that the breath almost
left him. But in the afternoon, when they sat
on the stone bench before the house door and sang two-part
songs about true love, the passers-by said: “The
silly old people!” However, the happy ones heard
them not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_857">[Pg 857]</span></p>

<p>So passed many years. The house had become too
small for the children. They had gone forth, had married
and had children of their own. The two old people
were again alone, and were as dear to each other
as on their wedding day; and every Sunday, when the
church-bell rang, each drank a drop from the flask.</p>

<p>Then once again the day of the summer solstice drew
near. On the evening before, Hans and Greta sat before
their door and looked toward the heights where
the St. John’s fire blazed, and from the distance sounded
the mirth of the young fellows and maids, who stirred
the fire and sprang through its flames in couples.</p>

<p>Then the wife said: “Dear Hans, I would like to
go once more to the forest. If thou desirest it also,
then will we start early in the morning. But thou
must waken me early, for when the elder blossoms the
young women like to sleep until the sun is high in the
heavens.”</p>

<p>Hans agreed. On the next morning he wakened his
wife, and they went together into the forest. They
walked like lovers, and each gave a careful heed to the
steps of the other.</p>

<p>When Hans cautiously jumped over the root of a
tree, the wife said: “Ah, Hans, thou leapest indeed
like a young kid!” and when Greta timidly stepped
over a little ditch, her husband laughed and cried:
“Tuck up your dress, Greta! Jump!” And then they
selected an old pine tree, feasting in its shade on what
Greta had brought with her.</p>

<p>“It was here,” said Hans, “where the wood-sprite
appeared to us that day, and there yonder must lie the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_858">[Pg 858]</span>
forest meadow with the fountain of youth. But I have
never again found the meadow and the spring.”</p>

<p>“And, God be thanked! that has mattered not,” hastily
interrupted Greta. “For our flask is still far from
being empty.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” nodded Hans. “But yet it
would please me if we could see the good wood-sprite
once again, and thank her for our good fortune. Come—let
us go and seek her. Perhaps I will be as lucky
to-day as formerly.”</p>

<p>Then they set out and went deeper into the forest,
and after a quarter of an hour saw there, before their
eyes, the sunny forest meadow. Lilies and bluebells
bloomed in the grass, gay-colored butterflies flew to
and fro, and on the edge of the forest stood also the
little house, just as in years before. They went toward
the house with beating hearts, and best of all, there was
indeed the fountain of youth at hand, and dragon-flies,
in green and gold, hovered over it.</p>

<p>Hans and Greta stepped to the brim of the spring.
They embraced each other and stooped over the water;
and from out the clear surface of the spring there confronted
them two gray heads with friendly, wrinkled
faces.</p>

<p>Then hot tears fell from the eyes of the old couple,
and they stood stammering and sobbing in mutual
guilt. It required a long time before it became clear
to them that each had deluded and for long years had
lovingly deceived the other.</p>

<p>“Thou hast also known that we have both grown
old?” cried out Hans, joyfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_859">[Pg 859]</span></p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” laughed the wife, amid
tears.</p>

<p>“And I, also,” rejoiced old Hans. Then he took his
wife and kissed her as on the day she had said “Yes”
to him.</p>

<p>Then the forest-sprite suddenly stood before them,
as if she had sprung out of the earth.</p>

<p>“Welcome,” said she. “You have not appeared before
me for a long time. But—but,” continued the
little woman, and threatened with her finger, “you have
kept a bad home with the water of youth. Wrinkles
and gray hair! Ah, ah! Now,” continued she again,
“that is easy to remedy, and you are come at a good
hour. Quick! Spring into the fountain of youth; it
is not deep; dip your gray heads under; then you shall
see a miracle. The bath will restore to you youthful
vigor and beauty. But quick, before the sun
sinks!”</p>

<p>Hans and Greta looked at each other.
“Wilt thou?” asked the husband, in an uncertain
voice.</p>

<p>“Never,” answered Greta, quickly. “Oh, if thou
only knowest how happy I am, that at last I may be
old! And, also, it would be impossible on account of
our children and grandchildren. No, gracious forest-sprite,
a thousand thanks for your good deed, but we
remain as we are. Is it not so, Hans?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Hans, “we remain old. If thou
couldst but know, Greta, how well your gray hair
becomes you.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” said the wood-sprite, a little vexed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_860">[Pg 860]</span>
“There is no ceremony here.” So speaking, she went
into the house and locked the door behind her.</p>

<p>But the old couple kissed each other anew. Then
they stepped homeward, arm in arm, through the forest,
and the midsummer sun shed a golden light upon
their gray heads.</p>

<p>Is it possible that there are people quite free from
curiosity? People who can pass on behind any
one they see gazing earnestly and intently toward
some unknown object without feeling an impulse to
stop, to follow the direction of the other’s eyes, to
discover what odd thing he may be looking at?</p>

<p>For my part, if I were asked whether I counted myself
among that class of cold natures, I do not know
that I could honestly answer “Yes.” At any rate, there
was once a moment in my life when I was not only
goaded by such an impulse, but when I actually yielded
to the temptation and fell into the way of any mere
curiosity seeker.</p>

<p>The place in which it happened was in a wine-room
in the old town where as Referendar<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I was practising
at court; the time was an afternoon in summer.</p>

<p>The wine-room, situated on the ground floor of a
house in the great square which from the window one
could look out upon in every direction, was at this
hour nearly empty. To me this was all the more
agreeable, for I have ever been a lover of solitude.</p>

<p>There were three of us: the fat waiter, who from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_864">[Pg 864]</span>a gray, dust-covered bottle was pouring out the golden-yellow
Muscatel into my glass; then myself, who sat
in a nook of the cozy, odd-cornered room and smacked
the fragrant wine; and still another guest, who had
taken his place at one of the two open windows, a
tumbler of red wine lying before him on the window-sill,
in his mouth a long brown, smoke-seasoned meerschaum
cigar-holder, out of which he wrapped himself
in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>This man, who had a long gray beard framing a
ruddy face tinged bluish in places, was an old retired
colonel, whom every one in town knew. He belonged
to that colony of the Superannuated who had settled
down in this pleasant place to wearily drag out the
end of their days.</p>

<p>Toward noon they could be seen strolling deliberately
in groups of twos or threes down the street,
shortly to disappear into the wine-room, where between
twelve and one they assembled at the round
table to gossip. On the table stood pint bottles of
sourish Moselle, over the table floated a thick mist of
cigar smoke, and through the mist came voices, peevish,
grating, discussing the latest event in the Army
Register.</p>

<p>The old colonel, too, was a regular patron of the
wine-room, but he never came at the hour of general
assembly, but later, in the afternoon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>He was a man of lonely disposition. Rarely was he
seen in the company of others; his lodging was in the
suburbs on the other side of the river, and from the
window of his room one could look out over a wide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_865">[Pg 865]</span>stretch of meadow land which the river regularly inundated
every spring, when it overflowed its banks.
Many a time I have passed by his lodging and seen
him standing at the window, his bloodshot eyes,
rimmed with deep bags beneath, thoughtfully gazing
out toward the gray waste of water beyond the embankment.</p>
</div>

<p>And now he sits there at the window of the wine-room
and gazes out upon the square, over whose surface
the wind sweeps along in a whirl of dust.</p>

<p>But what is he looking at, I wonder?</p>

<p>The fat waiter, bored to death over his two silent
fees, had his attention already drawn toward the colonel’s
behavior; he stood in the middle of the room, his
hands clasped behind the tail of his coat, and was gazing
through the other window out on to the square.</p>

<p>Something must surely be going on there.</p>

<p>Quietly as possible, so as not to break the interest
of the other two, I rose from my seat. But there was
really nothing to be seen. The square was nearly
empty; only in the centre, under the great street lamps,
I noticed two schoolboys who were facing each other
in threatening attitude. Could it be this, then, that so
fixed the attention of the old colonel?</p>

<p>But having once begun, such is the nature of man, I
could not withdraw my attention before knowing
whether this threat of a fight would really swell to an
outbreak. The boys had just come from afternoon
school session; they were still carrying their portfolios
under their arms. They may have been of equal age,
but one was a head taller than the other. This bigger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_866">[Pg 866]</span>
one, a tall, lank, overgrown schoolboy, with an unpleasant
look in his freckled face, was blocking the
way of the other, who was short and plump and had
an honest face with chubby, red cheeks. The bigger
boy seemed to be nagging at the other with taunting
words, but by reason of the distance it was impossible
to understand what he said. After this had been going
on for a while, the quarrel suddenly broke out. Both
boys dropped their portfolios to the ground; the little
chubby boy lowered his head, as though to ram his
opponent in the stomach, and then rushed at him.</p>

<p>“The big fellow there will soon have him in a fix,”
now said the colonel, who was earnestly following the
movements of the enemy, and who seemed not to
approve the tactics of the little chubby boy.</p>

<p>For whom he intended these words it would be hard
to say; he spoke them to himself without addressing
any one of us.</p>

<p>His prediction was at once justified.</p>

<p>The big fellow dodged the onset of his enemy; the
next moment he had his left arm squeezed around the
other’s neck, so that the head of the latter was caught
as in a noose; he had him, as they say, “in chancery.”
With his right hand he gripped the right fist of his
opponent, who was trying to pummel him with it on
the back, and when he had regularly trapped him and
brought him completely under his power he dragged
him again and again round and about the lamp-post.</p>

<p>“Clumsy lad,” muttered the old colonel, continuing
his monologue, “always to let himself get caught in
that way.” He was plainly disappointed in the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_867">[Pg 867]</span>
chubby boy, and could not endure the long, lanky
one.</p>

<p>“They fight that way every day,” he explained,
noticing the waiter, to whom he seemed willing to
account for his interest in the matter.</p>

<p>Then he turned his face again toward the window.</p>

<p>“Wonder if the little one will turn up!”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he mumbled this to the end when
there came rushing from the city park that adjoined
the square a slender little slip of a lad.</p>

<p>“There he is,” said the old colonel. He swallowed
a mouthful of red wine and stroked his beard.</p>

<p>The little fellow, who one felt sure by the resemblance
must be a brother of little Chubby Cheeks, but a
finer and improved edition, ran up, lifted high his portfolio
with both hands and gave Long-Shanks a blow
on the back that resounded away over to where we sat.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said the old colonel.</p>

<p>Long-Shanks kicked like a horse at this new assailant.
Little-Boy dodged, and the same instant Long-Shanks
got a second blow, this time on the head, that
sent his cap flying.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he still kept his prisoner held in the
trap and fast by the right hand.</p>

<p>Then Little-Boy tore open his portfolio with frantic
haste; from the portfolio he drew out a pen-case,
from the pen-case a pen-holder, which all at once he
began jabbing into the hand of Long-Shanks that held
his brother prisoner.</p>

<p>“Clever lad!” said the colonel to himself. “Fine
lad!” His red eyes fairly gleamed with delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_868">[Pg 868]</span></p>

<p>The affair was now becoming too hot for Long-Shanks.
Stung with pain, he released his first opponent
to throw himself with furious blows on Little-Boy.</p>

<p>But the latter was now transformed into a veritable
little wildcat. His hat had flown from his head, his
curly hair clung round his fine, deathly pale face, out
of which his eyes fairly burned; the portfolio with all
its contents was lying on the ground—over cap, portfolio
and all he went for the anatomy of Long-Shanks.</p>

<p>He threw himself on the enemy, and with little,
clenched, convulsive fists belabored him so on stomach
and body that Long-Shanks began to retreat step by
step.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Chubby-Cheeks had recovered himself,
snatched up his portfolio, and with blow after
blow on the sides and back of his oppressor, pushed
into the fight again.</p>

<p>Long-Shanks at last threw off Little-Boy, took two
steps backward and picked up his cap from the ground.
The fight was drawing to a finish.</p>

<p>Panting and out of breath, the three stood looking
at one another. Long-Shanks showed an ugly grin,
behind which he tried to hide the shame of his defeat;
Little-Boy, with fists still doubled, followed every one
of his movements with blazing eyes, ready at a moment
to spring once more upon the enemy should the latter
renew the attack. But Long-Shanks did not advance
again; he had had enough. Sneering and shrugging
his shoulders, he kept drawing away farther and farther
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_869">[Pg 869]</span>
until he had reached a safe distance, when he
began to call out names.</p>

<p>The two brothers now collected the belongings of
Little-Boy that lay scattered about, stuffed them into
the portfolio, picked up their caps, whipped the dust
from them, and turned homeward. On the way they
passed the windows of our wine-room. I could now
plainly see the brave little fellow; he was a thoroughbred,
every inch of him. Long-Shanks was again approaching
from behind and bawling after them through
the length of the square. Little-Boy shrugged his
shoulders with fine contempt. “You great, cowardly
bully,” said he, and stopping suddenly, turned right
about and faced the enemy. At once Long-Shanks
stopped too, and the two brothers broke out into derisive
laughter.</p>

<p>They were now standing directly under the window
at which the old colonel was sitting. He leaned out.</p>

<p>“Bravo, youngster!” said he, “you are a plucky one—here—drink
this on the strength of it.” He had
taken up the tumbler and was holding it out of the
window toward Little-Boy. The boy looked up, surprised,
then whispered something to his older brother,
gave him his portfolio to hold, and gripped the big
glass in his two little hands.</p>

<p>When he had drank all he wanted, with one hand
he held the glass by its stem, with the other took back
the portfolio from his brother, and without asking by
your leave, handed the glass over to him.</p>

<p>Chubby-Cheeks then took a long swallow.</p>

<p>“The blessed boy,” muttered the colonel to himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_870">[Pg 870]</span>
“I give him my glass, and without further ado he
makes his <em>cher frère</em> drink out of it, too.”</p>

<p>But by the face of Little-Boy, who now reached the
glass up to the window again, one could see that he
had only been doing something which seemed to him
quite a matter of course.</p>

<p>“Do you like the bouquet?” asked the old colonel.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks, very well,” said the boy, who snatched
at his cap politely, and went on his way with his
brother.</p>

<p>The colonel looked after them until they had turned
a corner of the street and disappeared from his
sight.</p>

<p>“With boys like that”—then said the colonel, returning
to his soliloquizing—“it is often an odd thing about
boys like that.”</p>

<p>“That they should fight so in the public streets!”
said the fat waiter with disapproval, still standing at
his post. “One wonders how the teacher can allow it;
and they seem to belong to good family, too.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that that does the harm,” grunted the old
colonel. “Young people must have their liberty,
teachers can’t always be keeping an eye on them.
Boys all fight—must fight.”</p>

<p>He rose heavily from his place so that the chair
creaked beneath him, scraped the cigar butt out of its
holder into the ash-tray, and walked stiffly over to the
wall where his hat hung on a nail. At the same time
he continued his reverie.</p>

<p>“In young blood like that nature will show itself—everything,
just as it <em>really</em> is—afterward, when older,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_871">[Pg 871]</span>
things look all much alike—then one is able to study
more carefully—young blood like that.”</p>

<p>The waiter had put his hat into his hand; the colonel
took up his tumbler again, in which there were still
a few drops of the red wine.</p>

<p>“God bless the youngsters,” he murmured; “they
have hardly left me a drop.” He looked, almost sadly,
into what remained of the wine, then set the tumbler
down again without drinking.</p>

<p>The fat waiter became suddenly alive.</p>

<p>“Will the colonel, perhaps, have another glass?”</p>

<p>The old man, standing at the table, had opened the
wine list and was mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>“H’m—another sort, maybe—but one can’t buy it
by the glass—only by the bottle—somewhat too much.”</p>

<p>Slowly his gaze wandered over in my direction; I
read in his eyes the dumb inquiry a man sometimes
throws his neighbor when he wants to go halves with
him over a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>“If the colonel will allow me,” I said, “it would give
me great pleasure to drink a bottle with him.”</p>

<p>He agreed, plainly not unwilling. He pushed the
wine list over to the waiter, lining with his finger the
sort he wanted, and said in a commanding tone: “A
bottle of that.”</p>

<p>“That is a brand I know well,” he said, turning to
me, while he threw his hat on a chair and sat down at
one of the tables—“it’s good blood.”</p>

<p>I had placed myself at a table with him so that I
could see his face in profile. His look was again
turned toward the window, and as he gazed past me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_872">[Pg 872]</span>
up into the heavens, the glow of the sunset was reflected
in his eyes.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had seen him at such close
quarters.</p>

<p>By the look of his eyes he was lost in dreams, and
as his hand played mechanically through his long
beard, there seemed to rise before him out of the flood
of the years that had rushed behind, forms that were
once young when he was young, and which were now—who
can say where? The bottle which the waiter
had brought and placed at a table before us contained
a rare wine. An old Bordeaux, brown and oily,
poured into our glasses. I recalled the expression
which the old man had used a short time before.</p>

<p>“I must admit, colonel, that this is indeed ‘good
blood.’”</p>

<p>His flushed eyes came slowly back from the far
away, turned upon me, and remained fixed there, as
if he would say: “What do you know about it?”</p>

<p>He took a deep draft, wiped his beard, and gazed at
his glass. “Strange,” he said, “when a man grows
old—he recalls the earliest days far easier than those
that come later.”</p>

<p>I was silent; I felt that I ought neither to speak nor
question. When a man is lost in recollections he is
making poetry, and one must not question a poet.</p>

<p>A long pause followed.</p>

<p>“What an assortment of people one has to meet
with,” he continued. “When one thinks of it—many
who live on and on—it were often better they did not
live at all—and others have to go so much too early.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_873">[Pg 873]</span>
He passed the palm of his hand over the surface of the
table. “Beneath that lies much.”</p>

<p>It seemed as if the table had become to him as the
surface of the earth, and that he was thinking of those
lying beneath the ground.</p>

<p>“Had to keep thinking of this a little while ago”—his
voice sounded hollow—“when I saw that little
fellow. With a boy like that nature comes right out,
fairly gushes out—thick as your arm. You can see
blood in it. Pity, though, that good blood flows so
freely—more freely than the other. I once knew a
little chap like that.”</p>

<p>And there it was.</p>

<p>The waiter had seated himself in a back corner of
the room; I kept perfectly quiet; the heavy voice of the
old colonel went laboring through the stillness of the
room like a gust of wind that precedes a storm or some
serious outbreak in nature.</p>

<p>His eyes turned toward me as if to search me,
whether I could bear to listen. He did not ask, I did
not speak, but I looked at him, and my look eagerly
replied: “Go on.”</p>

<p>But not yet did he begin; first he drew from
the breast pocket of his coat a large cigar-case
of hard, brown leather, took out a cigar and slowly
lighted it.</p>

<p>“You know Berlin, of course,” said he, as he blew
out the match and puffed the first cloud of smoke over
the table. “No doubt you have traveled before this on
the street railway—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; often.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_874">[Pg 874]</span></p>

<p>“H’m—well, then, as you go along behind the new
Friedrich Street from Alexander Square to the Jannowiz
Bridge, there stands there on the right-hand side
in new Friedrich Street, a great ugly old building; it
is the old military school.”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“The new one over there in Lichterfelde I do not
know, but the old one, that I do know—yes—h’m—was
even a cadet there in my time—yes—that one I
do know.”</p>

<p>This repetition of words gave me the feeling that
he knew not only the house, but probably many an
event that had taken place in it.</p>

<p>“As you come from Alexander Square,” he continued,
“there first comes a court with trees. Now
grass grows in the court; in my time it was not so, for
the drills took place there and the cadets went walking
there during the hours of recreation. After that
comes the great main building that encloses a square
court, which is called the ‘Karreehof,’ and there, too,
the cadets used to walk. Passing by from the outside,
you can’t see into the court.”</p>

<p>I nodded again in confirmation.</p>

<p>“And then comes still a third court; it is smaller,
and on it stands a house. Don’t know what it is used
for now; at that time it was the infirmary. You can
still see there the roof of the gymnasium as you pass
by; then next to the infirmary was the principal outdoor
gymnasium. In it was a jumping ditch and a
climbing apparatus and every other possible thing—now
it has all gone. From the infirmary a door led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_875">[Pg 875]</span>
out into the gymnasium, but it was always kept locked.
When one wanted to go into the infirmary, one had to
cross the court and enter in front. The door then, as
I said, was always locked; that is, it was opened only
on some special occasion, and that, indeed, was always
a very mournful occasion. For behind the door was
the mortuary, and when a cadet died he was laid
therein, and the door remained open until the other
cadets had filed by, and looked at him once more—and
he was then taken out—yes—h’m.”</p>

<p>A long pause followed.</p>

<p>“Concerning the new house over there in Lichterfelde,”
continued the old colonel in a somewhat disparaging
tone, “I know nothing, as I said, but have
heard that it is become a big affair with a great number
of cadets. Here in New Friedrich Street there
were not so many, only four companies, and they divided
themselves into two classes: Sekundaner and
Primaner, and to these two were added the Selektaner,
or special students, who afterward entered the army as
officers, and who were nicknamed ‘The Onions,’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> because
they had authority over the others and were
barely tolerated in consequence.</p>

<p>“Now in the company to which I belonged—it was
the fourth—there were two brothers who sat together
in the same class with me, the Sekundaner. Their
name is of no consequence—but—well, they were
called, then, von <em>L</em>; the older of the two was called by
the superiors L No. I, and the smaller, who was a
year and a half younger than the other, L No. II.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_876">[Pg 876]</span>
Among the cadets, however, they were called Big and
Little L. Little L, indeed—h’m.—”</p>


<p>He moved in his chair, his eyes gazed out into vacancy.
It appeared that he had reached the subject
of his reveries.</p>

<p>“Such a contrast between brothers I have never
seen,” he continued, blowing a thick cloud from his
meerschaum pipe. “Big L was a strapping fellow,
with clumsy arms and legs and a big fat head; Little
L was like a willow switch, so slender and supple. He
had a small, fine head, and light, wavy hair that curled
of itself, and a delicate nose like a young eagle’s, but
above all—he was a lad—”</p>

<p>The old colonel drew a deep sigh. “Now you must
not think that all this was a matter of indifference to
the cadets; on the contrary. The brothers had scarcely
entered the Berlin Cadet School from the preparatory
school (they came from the one at Wahlstatt, I believe)
when their status was at once fixed: Big L was
neglected, and Little L was the universal favorite.</p>

<p>“Now with such boys it is an odd thing: the big and
the strong, they are the leaders, and on whomsoever
these bestow their favor, with that boy all goes well.
It also procures for him respect from the others, and
no one ventures lightly to attack him. Such boys—here
again nature stands right out—much as it is
with the animals, before the biggest and strongest all
the rest must crouch.”</p>

<p>Fresh, vigorous puffs from the meerschaum accompanied
these words.</p>

<p>“When the cadets came down at recreation time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_877">[Pg 877]</span>
those who were good friends together met and would
go walking arm in arm around the ‘Karreehof’ and
toward the court where the trees stood, and so it was
always until the trumpet sounded for return to work.</p>

<p>“Big L—well—he attached himself just wherever he
could find attachment, and stalked sullenly ahead by
himself—Little L, on the contrary, almost before he
could reach the court was seized under the arm by two
or three big fellows and compelled to walk with them.
And they were Primaners at that. For ordinarily, you
must know, it never occurred to a Primaner to go
with a ‘Knapsack,’ or Plebe, from the Sekunda; it
was far beneath his dignity; but with Little L it was
different, there an exception was made. And yet he
was no less loved by the Sekundaner than by the Primaner.
One could see that in class, where we Sekundaner
boys, you know, were by ourselves. In class
we were ranged according to alphabet, so that the two
L’s sat together very nearly in the centre.</p>

<p>“In their lessons they stood pretty nearly even. Big
L had a good head for mathematics; in other things he
was not of much account, but in mathematics he was,
as you might say, a ‘shark,’ and Little L, who was not
strong in mathematics, used to ‘crib’ from his brother.
In all other respects Little L was ahead of his older
brother, and in fact one of the best in his class. And
right here appeared the difference between the brothers;
Big L kept his knowledge to himself, and never
prompted; Little L, <em>he</em> prompted, he fairly shouted—yes,
to be sure he did—.”</p>

<p>A tender smile passed over the face of the old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_878">[Pg 878]</span></p>

<p>“If any one on the front form was called upon and
did not know the answer—Little L hissed right
across all the forms what he ought to say: when it
came the turn of the back benches little L spoke the
answer half-aloud to himself.</p>

<p>“There was there an old professor from whom we
took Latin. During nearly every lesson he would
stop short in the middle of the class; ‘L No. II,’ he
would say, ‘you are prompting again! And that, too,
in a most shameless fashion. Have a care, L No. II,
next time I will make an example of you. I say it to
you now for the last time!’”</p>

<p>The old colonel laughed to himself. “But it always
remained the next to last time, and the example was
never made. For though Little L was no model boy,
more often quite the contrary, he was loved by both
teachers and officers as well—but how indeed could it
have been otherwise? He was always in high spirits,
as if receiving a new present every day, yet nothing
ever got sent to him, for the father of the two was
in desperately poor circumstances, a major in some
infantry regiment or other, and the boys received
hardly a groschen (24 cents) for pocket money. And
always as if just peeled out of the egg, so fresh—without
and within—eh, eh, altogether—”</p>

<p>Here the colonel paused, as if searching for an expression
that would contain the whole of his love for
this former little comrade.</p>

<p>“As if Nature had been for once in a proudly good-humor,”
he said, “and had stood that little fellow
upright on his feet and cried: ‘There you have him!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_879">[Pg 879]</span></p>

<p>“Now this was to be observed,” he continued, “that
just so much as the brothers differed, one from the
other, the more they seemed to cling to each other.
In Big L, indeed, one did not notice it so much; he
was always sullen and displayed no feeling; but Little
L could never conceal anything. And because Little
L felt conscious of this, how much better he himself
was treated by the other cadets, it made him sorry for
his brother. When we took our walks around the
courtyard, then one could see how Little L would look
at his brother from time to time, to see if he, too, had
some one to walk with. That he prompted his brother
in class and allowed him to copy from himself when
sight-exercises were dictated was all a matter of
course; but he also took care that no one teased his
brother, and when he observed him quietly from the
side, as he often did, without drawing his brother’s
attention to it, then his little face was quite noticeably
sad, almost as if he were a great care to him—”</p>

<p>The old man pulled hard at his pipe. “All that I
put together for myself afterward,” said he, “when
everything happened that was to happen; he knew at
the time much better than we did how matters stood
with Big L, and what was his brother’s character.</p>

<p>“This was, of course, understood among the cadets,
and it helped Big L none the more, for he remained disliked
after it as before, yet it made Little L all the more
popular, and he was generally called ‘Brother Love.’</p>

<p>“Now the two lived together in one room, and Little
L, as I said, was very clean and neat; the big one, on
the contrary, was very slovenly. And so Little L fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_880">[Pg 880]</span>
made himself servant to his brother, and it turned out
that he even cleaned the brass buttons on his uniform
for him, and just before the ranks formed for roll-call
would place himself, with clothes-brush in hand, in
front of his brother, and once more regularly brush
and scrub him—especially on those days when the
‘cross lieutenant’ was on duty and received roll-call.</p>

<p>“Well, in the morning the cadets had to go down
into the court for roll-call, and there the officer on
duty went up and down between the lines and inspected
their uniforms to see if they were in order.</p>

<p>“And when the ‘cross lieutenant’ attended to this,
then there reigned the most woful anxiety throughout
the company, for he always found something. He
would go behind the cadets and flip at their coats with
his finger to make the dust fly, and if none came, then
he would lift their coat-pockets and snap at them, and
so, beat our coats as much as we would, there was sure
to be left some dust lying on them, and as soon as the
‘cross lieutenant’ saw it, he would sing out in a voice
like that of an old bleating ram: ‘Write him down for
Sunday report,’ and then Sunday’s day off might go
to the devil, and then that got to be a very serious
matter.”</p>

<p>The old colonel paused, took a vigorous swallow
of wine, and with the palm of his hand squeezed the
beard from his upper lip into his mouth and sucked
off the wine drops that sparkled on the hair. Recollection
of the “cross lieutenant” made him plainly
furious.</p>

<p>“When one considers what sort of meanness it takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_881">[Pg 881]</span>
to so deprive a poor little fellow of the Sunday holiday
he has been hugging for a whole week, and all for a
trifle—bah! it’s downright—whenever I have seen any
one annoying my men—in later days that sort of
thing didn’t happen in my regiment; they knew this,
that I was there and would not tolerate it.—To be
rough at times, ay, even to the extreme if necessary,
to throw one into the guard-house, that does no harm—but
to nag—for that it takes a mean skunk!”</p>

<p>“Very true!” observed the waiter from the back part
of the room, and thus made it known that he was following
the colonel’s story.</p>

<p>The old man calmed himself and went on with his
story.</p>

<p>“Things went on this way for a year, and then came
the time for examinations, always a very special
occasion.</p>

<p>“The Primaners took their ensign’s examination,
and the Selektaners, who, as I have said, were called
‘Onions,’ the officer’s examination, and as fast as any
had passed the examination, they were dismissed from
the cadet corps and sent home, and it came about that
the second classmen, or Sekundaner, who were to be
promoted to first class, still remained Sekundaner for
a time.</p>

<p>“Well, this state of affairs lasted until the new Sekundaner
entered from the preparatory school and the
newly dubbed ‘Onions’ returned, and then once more
the wheelbarrow trudged along its accustomed way.
But in the mean time a kind of disorder prevailed,
more especially just after the last of the Primaners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_882">[Pg 882]</span>
had left—they were examined in sections, you know,
and then despatched, after which everything went
pretty much at sixes and sevens.</p>

<p>“There was now in the dormitory where the two
brothers lived a certain Primaner, a ‘swell,’ as he was
called by the cadets, and because he had made up his
mind, as soon as he should pass the examination and
breathe the fresh air again, to conduct himself like a
fine gentleman, he had had made for himself, instead
of a sword-belt like those the cadets procured from
the institution and wore, a special patent-leather belt
of his own, thinner and apparently finer than the ordinary
regulation belt. He was able to afford this much,
you see, for he had money sent to him from home.”</p>

<p>He had displayed this belt about everywhere, for he
was inordinately proud of it, and the other cadets
admired it.</p>

<p>“Now as the day arrived for the Primaner to pack
together his scattered belongings in order to go home,
he looked to buckle on his fine belt—and all at once
the thing was missing.</p>

<p>“A great to-do followed; search was made everywhere;
the belt was not to be found. The Primaner
had not locked it in his wardrobe, but had put it with
his helmet in the dormitory behind the curtain where
the helmets of the other cadets lay openly—and from
there it had disappeared.</p>

<p>“It could not possibly have disappeared in any other
way—some one must have taken it.</p>

<p>“But who?</p>

<p>“First they thought of the old servant who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_883">[Pg 883]</span>
accustomed to blacken the boots of the cadets, and
keep the dormitory in order—but he was an old trusty
non-commissioned officer, who had never during the
course of his long life allowed himself to be guilty of
the least irregularity.</p>

<p>“It surely could not be one of the cadets? But who
could possibly think such a thing? So the matter remained
a mystery, and truly an unpleasant one. The
Primaner swore and scolded because he must now
leave wearing the ordinary institution belt; the other
cadets in the room were altogether silent and depressed;
they had at once unlocked all their wardrobes
and offered to let the Primaner search them,
but he had merely replied: ‘That’s nonsense, of course;
who could think of such a thing?’</p>

<p>“And now something remarkable happened, and
caused more sensation than all that went before; all
at once the Primaner got back the belt.</p>

<p>“He had just left his room with his portmanteau in
his hand, and had reached the stairs, when he was
hastily called from behind, and as he turned about,
Little L came running up, holding something in his
hand—it was the Primaner’s belt.”</p>

<p>Two others happened to be passing at the time, and
they afterward told how deathly pale Little L was, and
how every member of his body was literally shaking.
He had whispered something into the ear of the Primaner,
and the two had exchanged all quietly a couple
of words, and then the Primaner affectionately stroked
the other’s head, took off his regulation belt, buckled
on the fine one and was gone; he had handed the regulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_884">[Pg 884]</span>
belt over to Little L to carry back. Naturally
the story could now no longer be concealed, and it all
came out accordingly.</p>

<p>“A new assignment of rooms was ordered; Big L
was transferred; and just at the time all this was taking
place, he had completed his removal to the new
quarters.</p>

<p>“Afterward it occurred to the cadets that he had
kept strangely quiet about the whole affair—but one
always hears the grass growing after it has grown.
So much, however, was certain; he had allowed no one
to help him, and when Little L put his hands to the work,
he became quite rough toward his little brother. But
Little L, ready to help as he always was, did not allow
himself to be deterred by this, and as he was taking
out of his brother’s locker the gymnasium drill jacket
that was lying neatly folded together, he felt all at
once something hard within—and it was the belt of
the Primaner.</p>

<p>“What the brothers said to each other at the moment,
or whether they spoke at all, no one has ever
learned; for Little L had still so much presence of mind
that he went noiselessly from the room. But hardly
was he out of the door and in the corridor, when he
threw the jacket on the ground, and without once
thinking of what might be made out of the affair, he
ran up behind the Primaner with the belt.</p>

<p>“But now, of course, it could no longer be helped;
in five minutes the story was the property of the whole
company.</p>

<p>“Big L had allowed himself to be driven by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_885">[Pg 885]</span>
devil and had become light-fingered. Half an hour
later it was whispered softly from room to room: ‘Tonight,
when the lamps are turned out, general consultation
in the company hall!’</p>

<p>“In every company quarters, you must know, there
was a larger room, where marks were given out, and
certain public actions proceeded with, in what was
called the company hall.</p>

<p>“So that evening, when the lamps were out, and
everything was quite dark, there was a general movement
from all the rooms, through the corridor; not a
door ventured to slam, all were in stocking feet, for
the captain and the officers still knew nothing and were
allowed to know nothing of the meeting, else we
would have brought a storm about our ears.</p>

<p>“As we came to the door of the company hall, there
stood near the door against the wall one as white as
the plaster on the wall—it was Little L. At the same
moment a couple took him by the hands. ‘Little L
can come in with us,’ they said; ‘he is not to blame.’
Only one of them all wished to oppose this; he was a
long, big fellow—he was called—name of no consequence—well,
then, he was called K. But he was
overruled at once; Little L was taken in with us, a
couple of tallow candles were lit and placed on the
table, and now the consultation began.”</p>

<p>The colonel’s glass was empty again. I filled it for
him, and he took a long swallow. “Over all this,” he
went on, “one can laugh now if one wills; but this
much I can say, for us we were not in a laughing
mood, but altogether dismal. A cadet a rascal—to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_886">[Pg 886]</span>
that was something incomprehensible. All faces were
pale, all speaking was but half aloud. Ordinarily it
was considered the most despicable piece of meanness
if one cadet reported another to the authorities—but
when a cadet had done such a thing as to steal, then
he was for us no longer a cadet, and it was for this
reason that the consultation was being held, whether
we ought to report to the captain what Big L had done.</p>

<p>“Long K was the first to speak. He declared that
we ought to go at once to the captain and tell him
everything, for at such meanness all consideration
ceases. Now long K was the biggest and strongest
boy in the company; his words, therefore, made a
marked impression, and besides, we were all of his
opinion at bottom.</p>

<p>“No one knew anything to object to this, and so
there fell a general silence. All at once, however, the
circle that had formed around the table opened and
Little L., who had till now been flattening himself
against the farthest corner of the room, came forward
into the centre. His arms hung limp at the side of his
body, and his face he kept lowered to the ground; one
saw that he wished to say something, but could not
find the courage.</p>

<p>“Long K was again laying down the law. ‘L No.
II,’ said he, ‘has no right to speak here.’</p>

<p>“But this time he was not so fortunate. He had always
been hostile to the two, no one quite knew why,
especially Little L. Moreover, he was not a bit popular,
for as such youngsters have once and for all a
tremendously fine instinct, they may have felt that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_887">[Pg 887]</span>
this long gawk lay hidden a perfectly mean, cowardly,
wretched spirit. He was one of those who never
venture to attack their equals in size, but bully the
smaller and weaker ones.</p>

<p>“At that broke out a whispering on all sides: ‘Little
L <em>shall</em> speak! All the more reason for him to speak.’</p>

<p>“As the little fellow, who was still standing there,
ever motionless and rigid, heard how his comrades
were taking his part, suddenly the big tears rolled
down his cheeks; he doubled his two little fists and
screwed them into his eyes and sobbed so heart-breakingly
that his whole body shook from top to bottom
and he could not utter a word.</p>

<p>“One of them went up to him and patted him on the
back.</p>

<p>“‘Take it easy,’ said he; ‘what is it you wish to
say?’</p>

<p>“Little L still kept on sobbing.</p>

<p>“‘If—he is shown up—’ he then broke out at long
intervals—‘he will be dismissed from the corps—and
then what will become of him?’</p>

<p>“There was silence everywhere; we knew that the
young one was perfectly right, and that such would
be the consequence if we reported him. Added to this
we also knew that the father was poor, and involuntarily
each thought of what his own father would say
if he should learn the same of his son.</p>

<p>“‘But you must see yourself,’ continued the cadet to
Little L, ‘that your brother has done a very contemptible
thing and deserves punishment for it.’</p>

<p>“Little L nodded silently; his feelings were entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_888">[Pg 888]</span>
with those who were censuring his brother. The cadet
reflected a moment, then he turned to the others.</p>

<p>“‘I make a proposition,’ said he; ‘and if it be accepted
we will not disgrace L No. I for life. We
will prove on his body whether he has any honorable
feelings left. L No. I himself shall choose whether he
wishes us to report him or whether we shall keep the
matter to ourselves, cudgel him thoroughly for it, and
then let the affair be buried.’</p>

<p>“That was an admirable way out. All agreed
eagerly.</p>

<p>“The cadet laid his hand on Little L’s shoulder.
‘Go along, then,’ said he, ‘and call your brother here.’</p>

<p>“Little L dried his tears and nodded his head quickly—then
he was out of the door and a moment after was
back again, bringing his brother with him.</p>

<p>“Big L ventured to look at no one; like an ox that
has been felled on the forehead, he stood before his
comrades. Little L stood behind him, and never once
did his eyes leave his brother’s slightest movement.</p>

<p>“The cadet who had made the foregoing proposition
began the trial of L No. I.</p>

<p>“‘Does he admit that he took the belt?’</p>

<p>“‘He admits it.’</p>

<p>“‘Does he feel that he has done something that has
made him absolutely unworthy of being a cadet any
longer?’</p>

<p>“‘He feels it.’</p>

<p>“‘Does he choose that we report him to the captain
or that we thrash him soundly and that the matter shall
then be buried?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_889">[Pg 889]</span></p>

<p>“‘He prefers to be soundly thrashed,’</p>

<p>“A sigh of relief went through the whole hall.</p>

<p>“It was determined to finish the matter at once
then and there.</p>

<p>“One of the boys was sent out to fetch a rattan, such
as we used for beating our clothes.</p>

<p>“While he was gone we tried to induce Little L to
leave the hall, so that he should not be present at the
execution.</p>

<p>“But he shook his head silently; he wished to remain
on hand.</p>

<p>“As soon as the rattan came, Big L was made to lie
face down on the table, two cadets seized his hands
and drew him forward, two others took him by the
feet so that his body lay stretched out lengthwise. The
tallow candles were taken from the table and lifted up
high and the whole affair had an absolutely gruesome
look.</p>

<p>“Long K, because he was the strongest, was to
perform the execution; he took the rattan in his
hand, stepped to one side, and with the force of his
whole body let the cane come whistling down on to Big
L, who was clothed only in drill jacket and trousers.</p>

<p>“The young fellow fairly rose under the fearful
blow and would have cried out; but in a second Little
L rushed up to him, took his head in both hands and
smothered it against himself.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t scream,’ he whispered to him; ‘don’t
scream, else the whole affair will get out!’</p>

<p>“Big L swallowed down the cry and choked and
groaned to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_890">[Pg 890]</span></p>

<p>“Long K again lifted up the cane, and a second
swish resounded through the hall.</p>

<p>“The body of the culprit actually writhed on the
table, so that the cadets were scarcely able to hold
him down by his hands and feet. Little L had wrapped
both arms around the head of his brother, and was
crushing it with convulsive force against himself. His
eyes were wide open, his face like the plaster on the
wall, his whole body was quivering.</p>

<p>“Throughout the hall was a stillness like death, so
that one could only hear the wheezing and puffing of
the victim whom the little brother was smothering
against his breast. All eyes were hanging on the little
fellow; we all had a feeling that we could not look on
at it any longer.</p>

<p>“When, therefore, the third blow had fallen and the
whole performance repeated itself just as before, a
general excited whisper followed: ‘Now, it is enough—strike
no more!’</p>

<p>“Long K, who had become quite red from the exertion,
was raising his arm again for the fourth blow,
but with one accord, three or four threw themselves
between him and Big L, tore the rattan from his
grasp, and thrust him back.</p>

<p>“The execution was at an end.</p>

<p>“The cadet aforesaid raised his voice once more,
but only half aloud.</p>

<p>“‘Now, the affair is over with and buried,’ said he,
‘let each one give his hand to L No. I, and let him that
breathes even a word of the matter be accounted a
rascal.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_891">[Pg 891]</span></p>

<p>“A general ‘Yes, yes,’ showed that he had spoken
entirely in accord with the mind of the others. They
stepped up to Big L and stretched out their hands to
him, but then, as at a word of command, they threw
themselves upon Little L. There formed a regular
knot about the lad, first one and then another wished
to grasp him by the hand and shake it. Those standing
at the back stretched out their hands ’way across
those in front, some even climbed on to the table to
get at him; they stroked his head, patted him on the
shoulder, and with it all was a general whispering:
‘Little L, you glorious rascal, you superb Little L.’”</p>

<p>The old colonel lifted his glass to his mouth—it was
as if he were forcing something down behind it.
When he set it down again, he drew a deep sigh from
the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p>“Boys like that,” said he, “they have instinct—instinct
and sentiment.</p>

<p>“The lights were turned out, all stole hushed
through the corridor back to their rooms. Five minutes
later every boy was lying in his bed, and the
affair was ended.</p>

<p>“The captain and the other officers had heard not a
sound of the whole matter.</p>

<p>“The affair was ended”—the voice of the speaker
grew thick; he had buried both hands in his trousers’
pockets and was gazing before him through the fumes
of the smoking cigar.</p>

<p>“So we thought that night, as we lay in bed.—Did
Little L sleep that night? In the days following, when
we assembled in class, it did not seem so. Before, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_892">[Pg 892]</span>
had been as if an imp were sitting in the place where
the lad sat, and, like a rooster, had crowed it over the
whole class—now it was as if there were a void in the
place—so still and pale he sat in his place.</p>

<p>“As when a man flicks the dust from the wings of
a butterfly—so was it with the little lad—I can not
describe it otherwise.</p>

<p>“On afternoons one always saw him now walking
with his brother. He may have felt that Big L would
now find less companionship than ever among the
others—so he provided company for him. And there
the two went, then, arm in arm, always around about
the Karreehof and across the court with the trees in
it, one as well as the other with head bent to the
ground, so that one scarcely saw that they ever spoke
a word.”</p>

<p>Again there came a pause in the narrative, again I
had to fill the empty glass of the colonel, who smoked
his cigar faster and faster.</p>

<p>“But all this,” he continued, “would perhaps have
worn itself out in course of time and everything have
gone on as before—but for people!”</p>

<p>He laid his clenched fist on the table.</p>

<p>“There are people,” said he, scowling, “who are like
the poisonous weed in the field, at which beasts nibble
themselves to death. With such people the rest poison
themselves!</p>

<p>“So then, one day we were having lessons in physics.
The teacher was showing us experiments on the electric
machine, and an electric shock was to be passed
through the whole class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_893">[Pg 893]</span></p>

<p>“To this end each one of us had to give his hand to
his neighbor, so as to complete the circuit.</p>

<p>“As now Big L, who was sitting next to Long K,
held out his hand to him, the lubber made a grimace
as if he were about to touch a toad and drew back his
hand.</p>

<p>“Big L quietly shrank into himself and sat there as
if covered with shame. But at the same instant Little
L is up and out of his place, over to his brother’s side,
at whose place, next to Long K, he seats himself, whose
hand he grips and smashes with all the force of his
body against the wooden form, so that the long gawk
cries out with pain.</p>

<p>“Then he grabbed Little L by the neck and the
two now began regularly to fight in the middle
of class.</p>

<p>“The teacher, who had been tinkering all this time
at his machine, now rushed up with coat-tails flying.</p>

<p>“‘Now! Now! Now!’ he cried.</p>

<p>“He was, you must know, an old man for whom we
had not exactly a great respect.</p>

<p>“The two were so interlocked that they did not
break away, even though the professor was standing
directly in front of them.</p>

<p>“‘What disgraceful conduct!’ cried the professor.
‘What disgraceful conduct! Will you separate at
once!’</p>

<p>“Long K made a face as if he were about to
cry.</p>

<p>“‘L No. II began it,’ he said, ‘though I did nothing
at all to provoke him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_894">[Pg 894]</span></p>

<p>“Little L stood straight up in his place—for we always
had to stand when a professor spoke to us—big
drops of perspiration coursed slowly down either
cheek; he said not a word; he had bitten his teeth
together so hard that one could see the muscles of his
jaw through the thin cheeks. And as he heard what
Long K said a smile passed over his face—I have never
seen anything like it.</p>

<p>“The old professor expatiated at some length in
beautiful set phrases over such disgraceful behavior,
spoke of the ‘utter depths of abysmal bestiality’ which
such conduct betrayed—we let him talk on; our
thoughts were with Little L and Long K.</p>

<p>“And scarcely was the lesson at an end and the professor
out of the door, when from the back a book
came flying through the air the whole length of the
class straight at the skull of Long K. And as he turned
angrily toward the aggressor, from the other side he
received another book on his head, and now there
broke out a general howling: ‘Knock him down!
Knock him down!’ The whole class sprang up over
tables and benches and there was a rush for Long K,
whose hide was now so thoroughly tanned that it fairly
smoked.”</p>

<p>The old colonel, pleased, smiled grimly to himself
and contemplated his hand as it still lay with fist
doubled on the table.</p>

<p>“I helped,” said he, “and with hearty good-will—I
can tell you.”</p>

<p>It was as if his hand had forgotten that it had grown
fifty years older; as the fingers closed convulsively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_895">[Pg 895]</span>
one could see that it was in spirit once again pummeling
Long K.</p>

<p>“But as people must belong once and forever to
their own kind,” he continued his narrative, “so this
Long K had to be naturally a revengeful, spiteful malicious
<em>canaille</em>. He would much rather have gone to
the captain and resentfully told him everything, but in
our presence he did not dare; for that he was too
cowardly.</p>

<p>“But that he had received a thrashing before the
whole class, and that Little L was to blame for it, for
that he did not forgive Little L.</p>

<p>“One afternoon, then, as recreation hour came
round again, the cadets went walking in the courts;
the two brothers, as usual, by themselves; Long K
linked arm in arm with two others.</p>

<p>“To get from the Karreehof to the other court
where the trees were, one had to pass under one of
the wings of the main building, and it was a rule that
the cadets must not pass through arm in arm, so as not
to obstruct the passageway.</p>

<p>“On this particular afternoon, as ill-luck would have
it, Long K, as he was about to pass through with
his two chums from the Karreehof to the other court,
met the two brothers at the corridor, and they, deep
in their thoughts, had forgotten to let go of one
another.</p>

<p>“Long K, although the affair was no concern of
his, when he saw this stood still, opened his eyes wide
and his mouth still wider, and called out to the two:
‘What does this mean,’ said he, ‘that you go through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_896">[Pg 896]</span>
here arm in arm? Do you intend to block the way for
honest people, you set of thieves?’”</p>

<p>Here the colonel interrupted himself.</p>

<p>“That is now fifty years ago,” said he, “and
more—but I remember it as if it had happened
yesterday.</p>

<p>“I was just going with two others from the Karreehof,
and suddenly we heard a scream come from the
corridor—I can not describe at all how it sounded—when
a tiger or other wild beast breaks loose from his
cage and throws himself on some one, then, I think,
one would hear something like it.</p>

<p>“It was so horrible that we three let our arms drop
and stood there quite paralyzed. And not only we, but
everything in the Karreehof stopped and suddenly
grew quiet. And then everything that had two legs
to run with kept rushing up at full speed toward the
corridor, so that it fairly swarmed and thickened black
around the corridor. I, naturally, with the rest—and
what I saw there—</p>

<p>“Little L had climbed on to Long K like a wildcat—nothing
else—and with his left hand hanging on by the
latter’s collar so that the tall gawk was half-choked,
with his right fist he kept up a crack—crack—and
crack right in the middle of Long K’s face, wherever
it happened to strike, so that the blood was pouring
from Long K’s nose like a waterfall.</p>

<p>“Now from the other court came the officer who
was on duty and broke his way through the cadets.
‘L No. II, will you leave off at once!’ he thundered—for
he was a man tall as a tree and had a voice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_897">[Pg 897]</span>
could be heard from one end of the Academy to the
other, and we had a wholesome respect for him.</p>

<p>“But Little L neither heard nor saw, but kept on belaboring
Long K in the face still more, and with it
came again and again that fearful uncanny shriek that
thrilled through us all, marrow and bone.</p>

<p>“When the officer saw that he took hold himself,
gripped the little fellow by both shoulders, and by
main force tore him away from Long K.</p>

<p>“As soon as he stood upon his feet, however, Little
L rolled up the whites of his eyes, fell his full length
to the earth, and writhed on the ground in a convulsion.</p>

<p>“We had never yet seen anything like it, and were
shocked and stared at it in absolute terror.</p>

<p>“But the officer, who had been bending down over
him, now straightened himself: ‘The lad certainly has
a most serious convulsion,’ said he. ‘Forward, two
take hold of his feet’—he himself lifted him under the
arms—over to the infirmary!’</p>

<p>“And so they bore Little L over to the infirmary.</p>

<p>“While they were carrying him there we went up to
Big L to learn just what had happened, and from Big
L and the other two who had been with Long K we
then heard the whole story.</p>

<p>“Long K was standing there like a whipped dog and
wiping the blood from his nose, and had it not been
for this nothing would have saved him from receiving
another murderous thrashing. But now all turned
silently away from him, no one ever spoke another
word to him; he made himself a social outcast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_898">[Pg 898]</span></p>

<p>The top of the table resounded as the old colonel
struck it with his fist.</p>

<p>“How long the others kept him in Coventry,” said
he, “I know not. I sat in class with him for a whole
year longer and spoke never a single word more to him.
We entered the army at the same time as ensigns; I
did not give him my hand at parting; do not know
whether he has become an officer; have never looked
for his name in the army register; don’t know whether
he has fallen in one of the wars, whether he still lives
or is dead—for me he was no more, is no more—-the
only thing I regret is that the person ever came into
my life at all and that I can not root out the remembrance
of him, forever, like a weed one flings into the
oven!</p>

<p>“The next morning came bad news from the infirmary.
Little L was lying unconscious in a burning,
nervous fever. In the afternoon his older brother was
called in, but the little fellow no longer recognized
him.</p>

<p>“And in the evening, as we all sat at supper in the
big common dining-hall, a rumor came—like a great
black bird with muffled beat of wings it passed through
the hall—that Little L was dead.</p>

<p>“As we came back from the dining-hall into company
quarters, our captain was standing at the door of
the company hall; we were made to go in, and there
the captain announced to us that our little comrade, L
No. II, had fallen asleep that night, never to wake
again.</p>

<p>“The captain was a very good man—he fell in 1866,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_899">[Pg 899]</span>
a brave hero—he loved his cadets, and as he gave us
the news, he had to wipe the tears from his beard.
Then he ordered us all to fold our hands; one of us
had to step forward and before all say ‘Our Father’
out loud—”</p>

<p>The colonel bowed his head.</p>

<p>“Then for the first time,” said he, “I felt how really
beautiful is the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>“And so, the next afternoon, the door that led from
the infirmary to the outdoor gymnasium opened, the
hateful, ominous door.</p>

<p>“We were made to step down into the court of the
infirmary; we were to see once more our dead comrade.</p>

<p>“Our steps shuffled with a dull and heavy sound as
we were marched over there; no one spoke a word;
one heard only a heavy breathing.</p>

<p>“And there lay little L, poor little L!</p>

<p>“In his white little shirt he lay there, his hands
folded on his breast, his golden locks curled about his
forehead, which was white like wax; the cheeks so
sunken that the beautiful, delicate little nose projected
quite far—and in his face—the expression—”</p>

<p>The old colonel was silent, the breath came choking
from his bosom.</p>

<p>“I have grown to be an old man,” he went on falteringly—“I
have seen men lying on the field of battle—men
on whose faces stood written distress and despair—such
heart sorrow as I saw in the face of this child
I have never seen before or since—never—never—”</p>

<p>A deep stillness took possession of the wine-room
where we were sitting. As the old colonel became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_900">[Pg 900]</span>
silent and spoke no word more, the waiter rose softly
from his corner and lit the gas-jet that hung over our
heads; it had grown quite dark.</p>

<p>I took up the wine bottle once more, but it was now
almost empty—just one tear still crept slowly out—one
last drop of the good blood.</p>

<p>For an hour the first regiment of Dragoons of
the Guard had been drawn up on level ground
behind a screen of low bushes, waiting the
order to engage. For some time the fighting appeared
to have ceased around them. Only a shattered
gun carriage and the ground, pierced with deep holes
like newly dug graves, heaped about with soft, yellowish
earth, gave the spot the look of a battlefield.
But the conflict was evident enough to the ear. On
all sides thundered the cannon, and from the right
came also the rattling of musketry. The roar of battle
rose and fell like the gamut of a great orchestra executing
the “Storm Movement” of the Pastoral Symphony.</p>

<p>In the foreground, on a slight elevation, a group of
officers were attentively examining the French position.
One of them, a Major, stood a little apart smoking
a cigarette and gazing dreamily into the distance.
He might not, perhaps, have attracted a feminine
observer, but a masculine eye would certainly have
marked him as a man of striking intellect. He was
about thirty, tall, slight, with cold gray eyes, a pale,
thin face and pale, sarcastic lips, just shadowed by a
delicate auburn mustache. This silent, self-contained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_904">[Pg 904]</span>man had about him an air of strange listlessness and
disenchantment that made him in every way a contrast
to the tanned, sunburnt young fellows who stood about
him, all on fire with the eagerness of battle. Taking
off his helmet, he passed his hand over his forehead.
It was an aristocratic, well-kept hand, with slender,
bloodless fingers. The whole appearance of this officer—which
even a uniform could not disguise—was that
of a person of exceptional distinction, and indeed he
was a person of very great distinction, being no other
than Prince Louis von Hockstein Falckenbourg Gerau,
the head of what was once a family of reigning princes.</p>

<p>Early left an orphan, the Prince found himself when
he came of age master of an almost unlimited fortune.
From his mother, a musician of exquisite sensibility,
he had inherited an artistic temperament and keen
sense of the beautiful; while from his father, a haughty
and somewhat eccentric noble, he had received a disposition
of such violence and independence that it
brooked no control from outside and recognized no
law but its own will.</p>

<p>It will take no great effort of the imagination to see
how the world had treated the young prince. The
Court distinguished him with special attentions; the
ladies petted him; the men sought him. In this hot-house
atmosphere of high life he came quickly to
maturity, and, like most children brought up among
older persons without companions of their own age,
he was of a thoughtful, even suspicious, temperament.
As, in addition to this, he looked at everything from
a critical, almost skeptical, point of view, insisting on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_905">[Pg 905]</span>
getting to the bottom of every question, he did not
make the mistake of most young men in his position—the
mistake of thinking the attentions paid him homage
to his own talent. Perfectly frank with himself,
he recognized that they were paid to his title and
fortune.</p>

<p>“What do these people really know of me?” he
often asked himself, on coming home from some Court
festival to the solitude of his magnificent palace.</p>

<p>“Nothing, and yet they scarcely wait for my mouth
to open to applaud my speech! But if all the words I
spoke this evening were written down and submitted
to a man of sense, his honest verdict would have to
be: ‘Well, perhaps this fellow isn’t exactly a fool, but
he certainly is mighty little over mediocrity.’ Yet the
world persists in treating me as if I were somebody!
But it is not <em>me</em>—Louis—that they are really concerned
with, but only Prince von Hockstein,” etc.</p>

<p><em>Louis</em> was actually jealous of <em>the Prince</em>. The latter
seemed to him an enemy, bent on thwarting and
overshadowing his real self, and the noble ambition
awoke in him to amount to something, in himself,
apart from his rank and fortune.</p>

<p>But this was easier said than done; everywhere the
Prince von Hockstein, etc., barred the way for Louis
and would not let him pass. He enrolled himself at
the University—the most aristocratic set among the
students hastened to pay him court. The professors
even, men whose genius until then he had revered, were
overcome with joy when he appeared in their classrooms,
and addressed their words markedly to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_906">[Pg 906]</span>
He soon had enough of this, and tried the army. His
colonel thanked him for the honor he did the regiment
in joining it; his superiors paid him flattering attentions;
his fellow officers bored him. Then, too, the
pettiness of garrison life was not much to his taste,
so he quitted active service, but not until he had been
rapidly promoted to the rank of major.</p>

<p>Of course, all this time women had played some
part in his life. There were a few trifling affairs with
actresses that did not go deep, and some passing flirtations
with women of the world. These last he quickly
found unbearable, for—except in being a thousand
times more exacting—the great ladies amounted to no
more than did the ballet girls.</p>

<p>One experience, however, came near being serious.
The Prince, traveling incognito through the Black Forest
to the watering-place of Norderney, chanced to take
a place in the coupé of the diligence next to a lady also
going to Norderney. She was of striking beauty and
fascination, and the Prince was completely bewitched.
He exerted himself immensely, but his attentions were
all received with courteous indifference. Perhaps it
was this indifference—a new experience—that charmed
him. After he reached Norderney he continued to pay
his court. He kept his incognito and simply called
himself Herr von Gerau.</p>

<p>The lady was surrounded by a crowd of admirers,
and accepted Louis’s daily bouquets just as she did
those of the others. She treated all her admirers with
indifference, possibly to the Prince her manner was a
shade colder than to the rest. At this critical moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_907">[Pg 907]</span>
a certain great personage, an acquaintance of
Louis, arrived at Norderney, and etiquette required
the Prince to pay him a visit of ceremony in full dress
uniform. Of course his name and rank could no
longer be concealed. The fair lady beheld her admirer
in his magnificent blue uniform, and learned who he
really was. Immediately she had eyes for no one else,
and seemed by smiles and glances to give him every
encouragement and to ask pardon for her former
neglect.</p>

<p>By way of answer, the Prince sent her a package
containing his uniform and jeweled pin in the shape of
a crown. These were accompanied by a note in which
he declared he gave her in perpetuity and in sole proprietorship
the only things she had cared for in him.</p>

<p>He was on the point of starting to hunt reindeer
in Norway when the war of 1870 broke out. He immediately
asked leave to join his regiment, and the
request, of course, was at once granted. Patriotism
and enthusiasm had very little to do with his action.
He rejoined his regiment in the first place because it
was the correct thing to do, and in the second because
he hoped that war might possibly give him some new
sensations. Was he again disappointed? He was inclined
to think so. Now for two weeks he had been
in the enemy’s country, and he had had no extraordinary
experience. When you have two good servants
and unlimited money, even in a campaign there are
few hardships, especially in a victorious army. As
for heroic deeds, there had simply been no occasion
for them. And the old weariness had come upon him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_908">[Pg 908]</span>
again, as he stood in front of his regiment, smoking
his cigarette.</p>

<p>The French artillery was now advancing upon the
ditch, and their balls struck the German batteries that
it defended, making great havoc. Two regiments of
infantry were ordered to the support of the batteries.</p>

<p>Marching first came the Third Westphalians. They
passed so near the group of officers that Prince Louis
could distinguish each face, each expression. The poor
fellows had been marching for fourteen hours under
the burning August sun. They were covered with dust
and sweat and their uniforms were soiled with mud.
But in no way did these heroes betray their deadly
fatigue. Their eyes, reddened by the heat, flamed
with the enthusiasm of war, their dry throats found
strength to shout “Hurrah!” The whole regiment
forgot their fatigue, and seemed, as they marched
under fire, like men refreshed and stimulated by a
generous draft.</p>

<p>“Poor devils,” thought the Prince, “they are running
to death as if it were a kermess dance. What
are they thinking about?—nothing, probably. They
are driven on by a blind desire of conquest. What
good will victory do them? How will it better their
lot—if they have the luck to escape death? Glory for
Germany? Perhaps for me that might be worth something,
hardly for them. Victory might add to the
splendor of my uniform. Still, I don’t know, I wear
it so seldom. Perhaps if I go to Japan next year, the
Mikado will receive me better if I belong to a victorious
nation, but whether we beat the French or they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_909">[Pg 909]</span>
beat us, I suspect I will always get the same welcome
at the Jockey Club in Paris and the Mediterranean
Club in Nice. But those nobodies over there, what
will their glorious and victorious country do for them?
They won’t get much of it in their village. All they
know of the ‘Fatherland’ is the taxgatherers and the
police, and they will be what they have always been.
And yet there they are full of enthusiasm, I can’t deny
it—it shakes even me. Well, we ought to thank the
poets who sing about patriotism and military glory,
and the schoolmasters who teach the people’s hearts
the poets’ words. Marvelous power of a word that
can lead a prosaic peasant to give his life for an
abstraction, an imagination!”</p>

<p>But even as with the quickness of lightning these
thoughts passed through his mind, the Prince felt a
sensation that amazed him. It was a feeling of confusion,
of shame. It seemed as if he had been speaking
his thoughts aloud and as if a group of grave and
noble figures had listened to his words, and were now
looking at him in a silence full of pity and disdain.
Down in the depths of his soul, where the mocking
light of his skeptical spirit failed to penetrate, he
seemed to hear an imperial voice rebuking him and
silencing his doubt.</p>

<p>“I am right,” his mind said.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” declared the voice.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, I shall not deceive <em>myself</em> with romantic
dreams,” cried Reason; but already it seemed
to the Prince that the words were spoken by a stranger,
and he shrank back from them indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_910">[Pg 910]</span></p>

<p>By this time the Third Westphalians had covered
the entire slope of the ditch, the sharpshooters were
already at the top. There was a moment’s hesitation,
for the first heads that appeared above the ditch called
forth a deadly fire from the enemy. Several men fell,
but those behind pressed on, and in spite of their terrible
fatigue, tried with hands and feet to make the
ascent that would have been play to men in good condition.
As they marched on, all on fire with noble
ardor, Heine’s words came back to the Prince: “How
I love the dear, good Westphalians! They are so sure,
so firm, so faithful. It is magnificent to see them on
the field of battle, those heroes, with their lion hearts.”</p>

<p>Pushed on by their “lion hearts,” the Westphalians
continued to scramble up the slope, expending their
last breath in the effort to go forward. But the
French, maddened by this outburst, forced them, after
a terrible combat man to man, to recoil to the bottom
of the ditch, which began to fill up with heaps of dead
and wounded. The survivors tried to retreat up the
other slope, and now the spectators above beheld a
heart-rending sight. The men were so completely exhausted
that they could not make the easy ascent. The
muskets fell from their hands, and the French made
many prisoners.</p>

<p>Above there was the greatest excitement. The
Eighth Westphalians arrived, commanded by the General
in person, and started immediately to the aid of
its comrades. The French were forced back and many
prisoners were recaptured. But the advantage was of
short duration. New masses of the enemy’s infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_911">[Pg 911]</span>
were coming up, and in the distance the cavalry were
seen approaching.</p>

<p>Prince Louis had followed the combat with increasing
emotion—he felt his heart beat alternately with joy
and fear. It seemed to him now that the critical moment
had come, and he read the same impression in
the faces of the other officers. The Colonel called his
orderly and sprang into the saddle. The trumpets
sounded, and a sudden movement passed through the
regiment. In a moment every one was on horseback,
sabres clinked against the spurs, the horses neighed.
Again the trumpets sounded and the whole troop began
the march.</p>

<p>Prince Louis glanced at his watch—it was half-past
six in the evening. As he rode along at the head of the
first squadron, a short distance from the Colonel and
adjutants, he felt himself seized by a sensation he had
never in his life experienced. The madness, the feverish
impatience of a moment before had melted away
with the consciousness of acting for a given purpose.
The knowledge of activity, of seeking a definite end,
brought him rest. He stopped looking for reasons;
he thought no more of criticizing. The spirit of doubt
was driven out of him. He obeyed with the ardor,
the belief, the simple obedience of a child, the irresistible
command that was pushing his entire being
forward. This man, so proud of his <em>ego</em>, he, who
had always sought happiness by the unlimited activity
of his personal will, now found that will so
crushed and bound that it was scarcely perceptible.
A Power, call it Natural Law, call it the Divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_912">[Pg 912]</span>
Will, that is ever manifesting itself by the course
of history, had entered into him and taken possession
of him. He was no longer master of his destiny,
he was taken out of himself by a stranger—was
it a supernatural vision, a great genius, a Delivering
Christ?—Louis felt himself only a screw, a rivet in
the machinery of the world’s history, and strange to
say this dissolving of his individuality in a great whole,
as complete as the melting of a piece of sugar in a
glass of water, caused him neither sorrow nor regret.
On the contrary, a strange pleasure penetrated his entire
being and made him tremble with joy. He felt
himself very small, yet at the same time he saw in
himself something great that transcended the limit of
his own personality. In a word, he had found at last
that sensation he had always desired. He was delivered
from his prison of egotism and at large among
great generalities.</p>

<p>The regiment was now descending the slope, avoiding
the heaps of dead and wounded. The horses
quickly ascended the opposite side and, the trumpets
sounding, the regiment separated into two lines and
advanced.</p>

<p>What followed might have been taken for a representation
of the conflict of the gods in Valhalla. The
French cuirassiers, riding toward the sun, were illumined
with an unearthly light, their shining sabres
seemed like tongues of flame, their cuirasses and helmets
shone like white-hot steel. The German dragoons
had their backs to the sun, and the long black
shadows of horses and horsemen galloping ahead along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_913">[Pg 913]</span>
the ground made it look as if sombre ghosts were
leading the living to the attack. The two troops met
with a terrible shock. The sublime vision of the moment
before was gone, and in its stead was a horrible,
confused mêlée. Men fought hand to hand, plunging
their sabres into the bodies of their enemies, without
knowing exactly what they did. The French were
forced to retreat, still fighting. The Germans pursued,
hurrahing with joy, their horses dripping with
blood.</p>

<p>The pursuit stopped near a little brook. Prince
Louis felt as if he were awaking from a dream;
he caressed his noble horse and looked about him.
The enemy’s artillery was being drawn off; the survivors
of the cuirassiers followed the artillery. In the
distance the columns of infantry were also retreating,
keeping up an irregular, ineffectual fire.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” observed a young lieutenant near
the Prince, showing him his sabre, “my sabre is covered
with blood up to the hilt, and yet I have not the
least idea how it happened.”</p>

<p>The Prince was about to answer, when he felt a
terrible blow on his chest, as if he had been struck by
the hand of an invisible giant, or by the horn of a
bull. He put his hand to his breast. It was covered
with blood. He just realized that he must have been
struck by a ball, when he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, he was lying on the
trampled ground, his head resting against a saddle.
His tunic was unfastened and his comrades were
standing about him. He felt no pain, only a sensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_914">[Pg 914]</span>
of great fatigue, hard to describe, a little like
that of a man who is drowning.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, Prince?” asked the lieutenant-colonel,
who was bending over him.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” he answered, in a voice that could
scarcely be heard, a slight smile on his lips, “as if I
must cry: ‘Long live the King, long live the Fatherland’.”</p>

<p>These were his last words.</p>

<p><em>Sudermann, born in Prussia, in 1857, began
as druggist’s clerk, then tutor, then journalist,
until finally he wrote “Honor,” a social satire
that now places him, with Hauptmann, leader of
the German naturalistic dramatists, as “Dame
Care” places him among German novelists.</em></p>

<p><em>The particular merit of Sudermann, as playwright,
lies in his ability to seize upon the
most convincing traits of character, and in describing
familiar things, with a vein of dry
humor. He has surprising invention of plot,
and skill in working it out, but his art is often
marred by cheap theatrical devices, brutalities,
and concessions to public taste. His language
is flexible, clear, rich in coloring.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A NEW-YEAR’S EVE CONFESSION</h2>
</div>

<p class="center big1">BY HERMANN SUDERMANN</p>

<p>Thanks be to God, dear lady, that I may
once more sit beside you for a peaceful chat.
The holiday tumult is past, and you have a
little leisure for me again.</p>

<p>Oh, this Christmas season! I believe that it was
invented by some evil demon expressly to annoy us
poor bachelors, to show us the more clearly all the
desolation of our homeless existence. For others a
source of joy, it is for us a torture. Of course, I
know, we are not all entirely lonely—for us also the
joy of making others happy may blossom, that joy
upon which rests the whole secret of the blessed holiday
mood. But the pleasure of joining in the happiness
of others is tainted for us by a touch of self-irony
partly, and also by that bitter longing to which—in
contrast to homesickness—I would give the name of
“marriage sickness.”</p>

<p>Why didn’t I come to pour out my heart to you?
you ask, you pitying soul, you—you that can give of
your sympathy in the same rich measure that others
of your sex save for their dainty malices. There’s a
reason. You remember what Speidel says in his delightful
“Lonely Sparrows,” which you sent me the
day after Christmas, with a true perception of my state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_918">[Pg 918]</span>of mind? “The bachelor by instinct,” he says, “does
not desire comfort. Once he is unhappy, he wishes to
have the full enjoyment of his unhappiness.”</p>

<p>Beside the “lonely sparrow” whom Speidel portrays,
there is another sort of bachelor, the so-called “friend
of the family.” By this I do not mean those professional
wreckers of homes, in whose eyes the serpent
glitters as they settle down comfortably at the hospitable
hearthstone. I mean the good uncle, papa’s
former school friend, who rocks the baby on his knee
while he reads the magazine essays to mama, carefully
omitting all the doubtful portions.</p>

<p>I know men who give up their entire lives to the
service of some family whose friendship they have
won—men who live on without desire by the side of
a beautiful woman whom in their hearts they secretly
adore.</p>

<p>You doubt me? Oh, it is the words “without
desire” that disturb you? You are right, perhaps.
In the depth of even the tamest heart some wild
desire lies, but—understand me here—it lies bound
in chains.</p>

<p>As an instance I would like to tell you about a conversation
which took place day before yesterday, on
New Year’s Eve, between two old, two very old, gentlemen.
It is my secret how I came to know of this
conversation, and I ask you not to let it go any further.
May I begin, then?</p>

<p>Picture to yourself, as a setting for my story, a high-ceilinged
room, old-fashioned in furnishings, lighted
by a green-shaded, impertinently bright hanging-lamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_919">[Pg 919]</span>
of the sort our parents had in use before the era of
petroleum. The cone of light that goes out from the
flame falls upon a round, white-clothed table, upon
which stands the various ingredients for a New-Year’s
punch, while several drops of oil show out broadly in
the centre of the table.</p>

<p>My two old gentlemen sat half in the shadow of the
green lamp-shade, moldering ruins both, from long-past
days, bowed and trembling, gazing before them
with the dull glance of the dimming eyes of age. One,
the host, is evidently an old officer, as you would recognize
at once from his carefully wound cravat, his
pointed, sharply-cut mustache, and his martial eyebrows.
He sits holding the handle of his roller-chair
like a crutch tightly clasped in both hands. He is motionless
except for his jaws, which move up and down
ceaselessly with the motion of chewing. The other,
who sits near him on the sofa, a tall, spare figure, his
narrow shoulders crowned by the high-domed head of
a thinker, draws occasional thin puffs of smoke from
a long pipe which is just about to go out. Among the
myriad wrinkles of his smooth-shaven, dried-up face,
framed in a wreath of snow-white curls, there lurked
a quiet, gentle smile, a smile which the peace of resignation
alone can bring to the face of age.</p>

<p>The two were silent. In the perfect stillness of the
room the soft bubbling of the burning oil, mingled
with the soft bubbling of the tobacco juice. Then, from
the darkness of the background, the hanging clock
began to announce hoarsely the eleventh hour. “This
is the hour when she would begin to make the punch,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_920">[Pg 920]</span>
said the man with the domed forehead. His voice was
soft, with a slight vibration.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the time,” repeated the other. The
sound of his speech was hard, as if the rattle of command
still lingered in it.</p>

<p>“I did not think it would be so desolate without
her,” said the first speaker again.</p>

<p>The host nodded, his jaws moving.</p>

<p>“She made the New Year’s punch for us four-and-forty
times,” continued his friend.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s as long as that since we moved to Berlin,
and you became our friend,” said the old soldier.</p>

<p>“Last year at this time we were all so jolly together,”
said the other. “She sat in the armchair there,
knitting socks for Paul’s eldest. She worked busily,
saying she must finish it by twelve o’clock. And she
did finish it. Then we drank our punch and spoke
quite calmly of death. And two months later they carried
her away. As you know, I have written a fat
book on the ‘Immortality of the Idea.’ You never
cared much about it—I don’t care for it myself now
that your wife is dead. The entire Idea of the Universe
means nothing to me now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she was a good wife,” said the husband of
the dead woman; “she cared for me well. When I
had to go out for service at five o’clock in the morning,
she was always up before me to look after my
coffee. Of course she had her faults. When she got
into philosophizing with you—h’m.”</p>

<p>“You never understood her,” murmured the other,
the corners of his mouth trembling in controlled resentment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_921">[Pg 921]</span>
But the glance that rested long on his
friend’s face was gentle and sad, as if a secret guilt
pressed upon his soul.</p>

<p>After a renewed pause, he began:</p>

<p>“Franz, there is something I want to tell you, something
that has long troubled me, something that I do
not want to carry with me to my grave.”</p>

<p>“Well, fire away,” said the host, taking up the long
pipe that stood beside his chair.</p>

<p>“There was once—something—between your wife
and me.”</p>

<p>The host let his pipe fall back again, and stared at
his friend with wide-opened eyes.</p>

<p>“No jokes please, doctor,” he said finally.</p>

<p>“It is bitter earnest, Franz,” replied the other. “I
have carried it about with me these forty years, but
now it is high time to have it out with you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that the dead woman was untrue
to me?” cried the husband angrily.</p>

<p>“For shame, Franz,” said his friend with a soft, sad
smile.</p>

<p>The old soldier murmured something and lit his
pipe.</p>

<p>“No, she was as pure as God’s angels,” continued
the other. “It is you and I who are the guilty ones.
Listen to me. It is now forty-three years ago; you
had just been ordered here as captain to Berlin, and I
was teaching at the University. You were a gay bird
then, as you know.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” remarked the host, raising his trembling old
hand to his mustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_922">[Pg 922]</span></p>

<p>“There was a beautiful actress with great black eyes
and little white teeth—do you remember?”</p>

<p>“<em>Do</em> I? Bianca was her name,” answered the other
as a faded smile flashed over his weather-beaten, self-indulgent
face. “Those little white teeth could bite,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“You deceived your wife, and she suspected it.
But she said nothing and suffered in silence. She was
the first woman who had come into my life since my
mother’s death. She came into it like a shining star,
and I gazed up to her in adoration as one might adore
a star. I found the courage to ask her about her
trouble. She smiled and said that she was not feeling
quite strong yet—you remember it was shortly after
the birth of your Paul. Then came New-Year’s Eve—forty-three
years ago to-night. I came in at eight
o’clock as usual. She sat over her embroidery and I
read aloud to her while we waited for you. One hour
after another passed and still you did not come. I
saw that she grew more and more uneasy, and began
to tremble. I trembled with her. I knew where you
were, and I feared you might forget the hour of midnight
in the arms of that woman. She had dropped
her work, I read no longer. A terrible silence weighed
upon us. Then I saw a tear gather under her eyelid
and drop slowly down upon the embroidery in her lap.
I sprang up to go out and look for you. I felt myself
capable of tearing you away from that woman by
force. But at the same moment she sprang up also
from her seat—this very same place where I am sitting
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_923">[Pg 923]</span></p>

<p>“‘Where are you going?’ she cried, terror in every
feature. ‘I am going to fetch Franz,’ I said. And
then she screamed aloud: ‘For God’s sake, <em>you</em> stay
with me at least—don’t <em>you</em> forsake me also.’</p>

<p>“And she hurried to me, laid both hands on my
shoulders and buried her tear-bedewed face on my
breast. I trembled in every fibre, no woman had ever
stood so near me before. But I controlled myself, and
soothed and comforted her—she was so sadly in need
of comfort. You came in soon after. You did not
notice my emotion, your cheeks were burning, your
eyes heavy with the fatigue of love. Since that evening
a change had come over me, a change that frightened
me. When I had felt her soft arms around my
neck, when I had felt the fragrance of her hair, the
shining star fell from its heaven, and—a woman stood
before me, beautiful, breathing love. I called myself a
villain, a betrayer, and to sooth my conscience somewhat
I set about separating you from your mistress.
Fortunately I had some money at my disposal. She
was satisfied with the sum I offered her, and—”</p>

<p>“The devil!” exclaimed the old soldier in surprise;
“then you were the cause of that touching farewell
letter that Bianca sent me—in which she declared
that she must give me up—although her heart would
break?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was the cause of it,” said his friend. “But
listen, there is more to tell. I had thought to purchase
peace with that money, but the peace did not come.
The wild thoughts ran riot all the more madly in my
brain. I buried myself in my work—it was just about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_924">[Pg 924]</span>
that time that I was working out the plan of my book
on the ‘Immortality of the Idea’—but still could not
find peace. And thus the year passed and New-Year’s
Eve came round again. Again we sat together here,
she and I. You were at home this time, but you lay
sleeping on the sofa in the next room. A merry
Casino dinner had tired you. And as I sat beside her,
and my eyes rested on her pale face, then memory
came over me with irresistible power. Once more I
would feel her head on my breast, once more I would
kiss her—and then—the end, if need be. Our eyes
meet for an instant; I seemed to see a secret understanding,
an answer in her glance. I could control
myself no longer; I fell at her feet and buried my
burning face in her lap.</p>

<p>“I lay there motionless for two seconds perhaps,
then I felt her soft hand rest cool upon my head, and
her voice, soft and gentle, spoke the words: ‘Be brave,
dear friend; yes, be brave—do not deceive the man
sleeping so trustfully in the next room.’ I sprang up
and gazed about, bewildered. She took a book from
the table and handed it to me. I understood, opened
it at random, and began to read aloud. I do not know
what it was I read, the letters danced before my eyes.
But the storm within my soul began to abate, and when
twelve o’clock struck, and you came in sleepily for the
New-Year’s wishes, it was as if that moment of sin
lay far, far behind me, in days that had long passed.</p>

<p>“Since that day I have been calmer. I knew that
she did not return my love, and that I had only pity
to hope from her. Years passed, your children grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_925">[Pg 925]</span>
up and married, we three grew old together. You
gave up your wild life, forgot the other women, and
lived for one alone, as I did. It was not possible that
I should ever cease to love her, but my love took on
another shape; earthly desires faded, and a bond of
the spirit grew up between us. You have often laughed
when you heard us philosophizing together. But if
you had known how close were our souls at such moments
you would have been very jealous. And now
she is dead, and before the next New-Year’s Eve comes
round we two may follow her. It is, therefore, high
time that I rid myself of this secret and say to you,
‘Franz, I sinned against you once, forgive me.’”</p>

<p>He held out an imploring hand toward his friend;
but the other answered, grumbling: “Nonsense. There
is nothing to forgive. What you told me there, I knew
it long ago. She confessed it herself forty years ago.
And now I will tell you why I ran after other women
until I was an old man—because she told me then that
you were the one and only love of her life.”</p>

<p>The friend stared at him without speaking, and the
hoarse clock began to strike—midnight.</p>

<p><em>Not long ago, in 1895, Gabriele Reuter published
a book called, in the translation, “Of
Good Family.” It was very popular, for it
was not only well written, in an up-to-date,
realistic style, softened by imagination, but it
dealt with the position of the modern woman—it
was full of moving pictures of family life
and manners. Since then the author has stood
in Germany as the woman-weaver of questions
and problems concerning her own sex, in realistic
but sober colors.</em></p>

<p>The temptation to wait over a train and visit
my old friend in his new home was very
strong. I decided to do it.</p>

<p>I found his name on the door of a pretty little villa
in an attractive street.</p>

<p>“Would you wait a little? The doctor is expected
home at any moment,” the servant told me, as she
ushered me into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Will you give my card to Mrs. Hartens?” I said.</p>

<p>I was rather curious to see the woman he had
chosen, this dear, queer old chap, this enthusiast for
Hellenic ideals and the cult of free natural beauty.</p>

<p>When the servant had left me alone I looked curiously
around the room. I saw curtains of expensive
plush, carved mahogany furniture, a clean-washed
palm, heavy bronze lamps—the usual sort of things
that are given for wedding presents among well-to-do
people. There was nothing that could be called
ugly—and yet—and this was where he lived now?
This was the result of all his dreams?</p>

<p>But why didn’t she come?</p>

<p>Probably the young wife could not make up her
mind whether she ought to receive her husband’s old
friend in his absence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_930">[Pg 930]</span></p>
<p>I yawned a little. Time was flying, and I did not
know when I might ever pass through this town again.
I looked absent-mindedly over the table beside which
I sat. On it there stood a majolica plate holding visiting
cards, surrounded by large, handsomely bound
books. To the right of the plate there stood a vase
with fresh flowers. To the left, slightly to one side,
there was a little mother-of-pearl bowl, in which lay
an amulet with an engraved stone and a tiny smelling
bottle of Venetian glass, the sort of thing that looks
expensive and probably costs but a few soldi.</p>

<p>I heard a noise in the room adjoining, listened impatiently,
and then took the amulet in my hand and
examined the stone. It bore a finely worked head of
Apollo.</p>

<p>A carriage stopped before the house. A carriage?
Then Philip must have a good practise. Strange—I
could imagine that he would be more apt to explain
to his patients that all medical theory was a swindle
anyhow—</p>

<p>A shout of rejoicing came from the corridor: “Oh,
but that’s great! But, dearest, why didn’t you—”</p>

<p>“I did not think it was right—without you.”</p>

<p>“Little goosie! Dearest little goosie!”</p>

<p>Then followed a storm of kisses, interrupted by a
reproach: “Oh, Philip, she can hear everything.”</p>

<p>“Of course she can! Let her!” he cried happily,
tore the door open, and pushed a pretty little blond,
doll-like creature before him into the room.</p>

<p>“There—there you are! You must love each other,
you two!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_931">[Pg 931]</span></p>

<p>His delicate, scholarly face shone in purest joy.
The young wife held out her hand to me and told me
that she was very happy to make my acquaintance,
Philip had told her so much about me.</p>

<p>And yet she kept me waiting for half an hour!</p>

<p>When she left us to order another plate for the
dinner-table, Philip’s eyes followed her, shining with
love. And then he explained to me that his choice had
been dictated mainly by common sense, because he
believed it necessary for his restless experimenting
nature to have some one at his side whose character
was calm and decided. And his little wife was very
firm and decided.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Four years had passed before I again found an opportunity
to hear anything from the young couple.</p>

<p>Philip never wrote letters, on principle. I therefore
should hardly have felt that I had a right to call
him my friend. And yet I made a detour that I might
visit him and his wife.</p>

<p>The silence in the house was noticeable. And the
undisturbed order everywhere was almost distressing.
It was as if the furniture were never used. A door
opened cautiously and was shut again equally carefully.
A carefully deadened step approached the room,
and Philip entered, alone.</p>

<p>“This <em>is</em> nice! It’s awfully good of you,” he said
cordially, giving me both his hands.</p>

<p>But after the first greeting I noticed an embarrassment
in his manner, a something which had never
been part of his character before. With a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_932">[Pg 932]</span>
formal politeness, he explained to me that his wife
was ill, but that he would go and see if she would not
feel equal to a word with me.</p>

<p>After some time he returned, alone, as before.
“Theresa asks that you will do us the pleasure of
dining with us to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Then he suggested that he and I should spend the
evening in a concert garden.</p>

<p>Several hours passed happily under the green trees,
cheered with the sound of pleasantly distant music,
and enlivened by one of our old-time conversations.
Philip became quite himself again. He had the nature
of a poet, who can form anew for himself the ancient
dreams of all mankind. And he was something of a
reformer also. As he described to me what his ideal
of life would be, an existence without family ties,
without exacting sentimentality and excitement, a life
of pure calm beauty, I could not avoid the question:
“But what in the world can you do with all this part
of your nature in your present existence?” A second
later I was sorry for what I had said; his smile was
like an expression of pain.</p>

<p>Toward noon the following day Philip called on me
at the hotel.</p>

<p>His eyes were dull, his spiritual, mobile features
were dead and set in heavy lines.</p>

<p>“I must ask your pardon,” he murmured. “Theresa
does not feel well enough yet to see anybody. I
thought as much yesterday.”</p>

<p>I inquired sympathetically as to the trouble.</p>

<p>“She could pull herself together perfectly well. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_933">[Pg 933]</span>
she won’t. She won’t do it, just because it would
please me,” he murmured in suppressed anger,
throwing back his head impatiently, with a moan as
of pain. “And I—I need joy and merriment—and
brightness— And—you saw what it was yesterday.
That’s the way it always is now—always.”</p>

<p>“But you are a physician,” I exclaimed. “Can you
not give orders? This shutting herself up is all wrong
for a young woman like that.”</p>

<p>He burst out into a loud, bitter laugh. “A physician?— Why,
she thinks I’m ill and she is well— And
that isn’t all— She never can forgive me for our
child’s death—” He stared out ahead of him as if he
were looking into a world of misery.</p>

<p>“But how dare she?” I whispered. “A thing like
that—is fate.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “I am a physician—I
should have helped.”</p>

<p>And then he told me the story in a dull and weary
tone. An epidemic of scarlet fever had broken out in
the city. His wife had demanded that he should refuse
to treat severe cases, in consideration for herself
and the child. He would not comply with her wish
and brought the infection into the house. “From her
point of view, Theresa is quite right in hating me,” he
said, thoughtfully. “But she acts and talks as if it
were only her child—it was <em>my</em> son also.”</p>

<p>We set out for a restaurant that he had recommended.
He was quiet and absent-minded. Suddenly
he looked at his watch and said: “You’re an
independent woman. You don’t mind going there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_934">[Pg 934]</span>
alone, do you? I have a patient to visit and will meet
you there later. Will this suit you?”</p>

<p>I assented, understanding that he had already repented
of his confession and wished to be alone. I
waited the rest of the afternoon, but without the hope
of seeing him again. He did not come, and I left the
town that evening.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was in quite another city, in another corner of
Germany, where I was visiting relatives, when one day
some one asked me: “Aren’t you a friend of Dr. Philip
Hartens? According to the directory he lives here
now, quite near us. Would you want to look him up?”</p>

<p>“Of course I would.”</p>

<p>An hour later I might have believed that the six
years which had passed between that day and my first
visit to the young couple had been a dream only. For
I sat beside the very same table at which I had waited
before. The friendly spring sunshine shone on the
gold lettering of the large books that surrounded the
majolica plate, mirrored itself in the vase with fresh
flowers, and awoke a delicate play of color from the
little mother-of-pearl bowl. There were also the amulet
with the head of Apollo and the little glass bottle.
The sight of these old friends caused me to smile, just
as Theresa entered. The delicate outlines of her figure
had not changed, she had become frozen into them, as
it were. There was something of the old maid about
her, and the stubbornness, which had been a piquant
touch in her soft young face, was now hardened into
the chief quality of its expression. She took my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_935">[Pg 935]</span></p>

<p>“I’m very sorry to hear that Philip is away.”</p>

<p>“My husband has left me,” was her short, sharp
answer.</p>

<p>I looked at her, dazed. “Why—?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I suppose you did not imagine that he would
forget himself to that extent?” She smoothed her little
black silk apron and looked at me with an expression
that was almost scorn.</p>

<p>“No—I certainly should not have believed that,”
I answered candidly. “How could it have happened?”</p>

<p>Naturally, I did not expect an explanation. But
Theresa began of herself to tell me the story of her
unhappy marriage; began to tell it with a self-possession
which showed that she felt assured of a tribute of
sympathy from every one. She told me of her fruitless
attempts to make of her husband a sensible, useful,
practical husband and citizen. For a time everything
seemed to go right—until the child died. But
from then on his guilty conscience had drawn him
more and more away from her and from her influence.
He neglected his practise more and more, he spoke
quite openly in terms of scorn about his profession,
he fell into bad company, began to go about with people
who let their hair grow and didn’t wear shoes—and
with them he appeared to have entirely lost all
sense of what was decent and sensible.</p>

<p>I listened in silence, shocked in my inmost heart to
see how her hatred seemed to have robbed this woman
of all sense of shame.</p>

<p>“But Philip is a noble and true character,” I said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_936">[Pg 936]</span>
finally. “He goes his own way perhaps— But, believe
me, he will come to himself again in solitude.”</p>

<p>“In solitude?” she queried, with a scornful dropping
of the corners of her mouth. “Philip is utterly
ruined, I tell you. Because I refused to become a
pupil to his immoral theories of life, he sought and
found a more credulous companion. He is with her
now, in Greece, I believe, or God knows where—”</p>

<p>The faded eyes in the embittered little face gazed
angrily into the distance, as if her spirit followed her
husband and the other woman.</p>

<p>Then her glance fell slowly back to the table, and
she noticed that during her narrative I had mechanically
taken the amulet from the little pearl bowl and
had let it fall upon one of the books.</p>

<p>Crushing her moistened handkerchief in her left
hand, with the right she took up the amulet, laid it
back in its place beside the little glass bottle, and
pushed the little bowl until it stood just as it had
before, to the left side of the majolica plate.</p>

<p>Then I understood my poor friend, and my heart
forgave him.</p>

<p><em>Fulda’s greatest achievement, perhaps, is his
translation into German of Molière’s masterpieces,
the success of which probably led him
to also translate De Rostand’s “Cyrano de
Bergerac.” But his popularity rests chiefly on
his dramas, the best known of which is “The
Talisman,” and on his short stories. When
Fulda went to Munich in 1884, he came for a
short time under the influence of Paul Heyse,
evident in his short stories of the period, but
soon fell into the inevitable realism of the
present age in fiction. Later still he applied
himself closely to the study of the language
and artistic form of poetry. It is not surprising,
then, to find his style so graceful and
elegant.</em></p>

<p><em>Fulda was born in 1862 at Frankfort-on-Main.
His early studies at Heidelberg, Berlin,

philology, history of literature, and philosophy.

<p>Dear Gustav—I have some news to tell
you to-day which will certainly surprise you.
I have separated from my wife, or rather we
have separated from each other. We have come to an
amicable agreement henceforth to live entirely independent
of each other. My wife has gone to her family
in Freiburg, where she will no doubt remain. I
am for the present in our old house; perhaps in the
spring I may look for a smaller house—perhaps not,
for I can hardly hope to find so quiet a workroom as
I now have, and the idea of moving appals me, especially
when I think of my large library. You will, of
course, want to know what has happened, though, to
tell the truth, nothing has happened. The world will
seek for all possible and impossible reasons why two
people who married for love and who have for eleven
years lived what is called happily together should now
have decided to part. Yes, this world which thinks
itself so wise, but whose judgments are nevertheless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_940">[Pg 940]</span>so petty, so superficial, will doubtless be of the opinion
that there is something hidden—will include this case
too in one of the two great categories prepared for
such affairs, because it can not conceive of the fact
that life in its inexhaustible variety never repeats itself
and that the same circumstances may assume different
aspects according to the character and disposition of
those interested. I need not tell you this, my dear
Gustav. You will understand how two finely organized
natures should rebel against a tie which binds
them together after they have once become fully convinced
that in all matters of real importance a mutual
understanding was impossible.</p>

<p>My wife and I are too unlike. Between her views
of life and mine there yawns an impassable gulf. The
first few years I hoped to influence her, to win her to
my ways of thinking—she seemed so docile, so yielding,
took so warm an interest in my work, so willingly
allowed herself to be taught by me. Not till after
our children’s death did she begin to change. Her
grief at this loss—a grief which neither of us has ever
been able to live down—matured her, made her independent
of me. A tendency to morbid introspection
took possession of her, and gave increased tenacity to
those ideas and convictions which my influence had
hitherto held in check, though not wholly eradicated.
She plunged deeper and deeper into those mists of sentimentally
fantastic imaginings, passionately demanding
my concurrence in her views. She lost all interest
in my professional work, evidently regarding the results
of my researches in natural science as troops from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_941">[Pg 941]</span>
an enemy’s camp. At last there was hardly a subject
in the wide realm of nature and human existence on
which we agreed. To be sure we never came to an
open quarrel, but the breach between us was constantly
widening. Every day we saw more and more plainly
that though we lived side by side, we no longer belonged
to each other. This discovery irritated and
distressed us, and at last forced all other feelings into
the background. If we had not once loved each other
so dearly, or even if we had now ceased to feel a
mutual respect, this state of affairs might perhaps have
lasted for years, but our ideas of the true meaning of
marriage were too lofty, our sense of our own dignity
as human beings too profound to permit us to be content
with so incomplete a realization of our ideals. I
hardly know who spoke first, but our resolution was
at once taken, and the decisive words uttered as calmly
and naturally as the overripe fruit falls from the tree.
For the first time in many years we were able with
perfect unanimity of sentiment to discuss a subject of
the greatest importance to us both, and this fact alone
soothed our overwrought nerves. We parted yesterday
with the utmost decorum, without a word of reproach,
a note of discord. Memories of our early
married life, of the long years we had lived together,
made it difficult to refrain from some manifestation
of tenderness, and I assure you that I never felt greater
respect for my wife than at the moment when, all petty
considerations cast aside, the true magnanimity of her
nature asserted itself. Her manner, what she said, and
also what she did not say, robbed the situation of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_942">[Pg 942]</span>
trace of the commonplace, and gave it dignity. Deeply
moved, almost in tears, we clasped hands in farewell,
so we may look back upon the closing scene of our
wedded life with unalloyed satisfaction.</p>

<p>I had already, with her consent, referred all business
details to our lawyers, for we were not even to communicate
with each other by letter.</p>

<p>Life must begin again for both of us, and already I
breathe more freely. The Rubicon is passed. I believe
that you will congratulate me.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Prof. Max Wiegand to Dr. Gustav Strauch</span>.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, December 12.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gustav</span>—Pardon me that I have so long
delayed thanking you for your answer of friendly
sympathy to my last letter.</p>

<p>I have been in no condition to write, and even now
find it difficult. You congratulate me without reserve
on a step which you regard as essential to my welfare
and to my intellectual development, but you do not
take into consideration what it means to separate from
one who has for eleven years been one’s constant companion,
day and night. Indeed, it is only during these
last dreary weeks that I, myself, have realized what
the change signifies to me. Habit is all powerful,
especially with men who, like you and me, live in
the intellectual world and so require a solid substructure.</p>

<p>How are we to take observations from the tower
battlements when its foundations are not firmly established?
Of course, I am as certain as ever I was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_943">[Pg 943]</span>
our decision is for the best interests of us both, but in
this queer world of ours we can take no step without
unlooked-for results.</p>

<p>I am bothered from morn till night with trifles to
which I have never given a thought since my bachelor
days—things which I will not mention, so absurdly insignificant
are they—and yet they rob me of my time
and destroy my peace. I am at a loss what steps to
take to rid myself of the thousand petty cares and annoyances
which my wife has hitherto borne for me.
These servants! Now that the cat is away they think
that they can do just as they please, and you have no
idea of the silly obstacles over which I am continually
stumbling, of the wretched pitfalls which beset my
path. Here is one instance out of many: For several
days it has been very cold, and I can not find
my fur coat. With the chambermaid’s assistance I
have turned the whole house upside down, until she
finally remembered that my wife, last spring, sent
it to a furrier’s to be kept from the moth. But to
which furrier? I have been to a dozen and can not
find it.</p>

<p>If I had only not agreed with my wife that we were,
under no circumstances, to write to each other, I should
simply ask her—but it is best so. No strain of the
commonplace must mingle with the sad echoes of our
farewell. No—a farce never follows a drama. Perhaps
she might even imagine that I seize the first pretext
to renew relations with her.</p>

<p>Never!</p>

<p>To-day it is six below zero.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, December 14.<br></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Emma</span>—You will be greatly surprised at receiving
a letter from me in spite of our mutual
agreement, but do not fear that I have any intention
of opening a correspondence with you. Our relations
terminated with all possible dignity, and the sealed
door shall never be reopened. I have but to ask a
simple question which you alone can answer. What
is the name of the man to whom you sent my fur coat
last spring? Lina has forgotten the address. Hoping
soon to receive an answer, for which I thank you in
advance,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;">
<span class="smcap">Freiburg</span>, December 15.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Max</span>—His name is Palaschke, and he is on
Zimmer Street. I can not understand Lina’s forgetfulness,
as she took the coat there herself.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Emma.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Prof. Max Wiegand to Frau Emma Wiegand.</span></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, December 17.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Emma</span>—I must trouble you once more—for
the last time. Herr Palaschke refuses to let the coat
go without the ticket, as he has had several disagreeable
experiences which have made it necessary to be
very strict. But where <em>is</em> the ticket? I spent the whole
morning looking for it, and, of course, Lina has not
the slightest idea where it is. She flew into a rage
when I found a little fault with her, and she leaves the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_945">[Pg 945]</span>
house to-morrow. I prefer paying her till the end of
her engagement, and shall also give her a moderate
Christmas gift, for I can not stand such an impertinent
person about me.</p>

<p>Well—be so kind as to write me a line telling me
where to find the ticket. I have already taken a severe
cold for want of the fur coat.</p>

<p>Hoping that you are well and quite comfortable with
your family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frau Emma Wiegand to Prof. Max Wiegand.</span></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Freiburg</span>, December 19.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Max</span>—The ticket is either in the second or
third upper drawer of the little wardrobe in the dressing-room
or in my desk, in the right or left pigeonhole.
I could find it in a minute if I were there. Lina
has great faults, but she is very respectable. I doubt
whether you can do better, and now, just before Christmas,
you will not be able to replace her. You should
have put up with her at least a fortnight longer, but it
is none of my business. I hope your cold is better.
I am quite well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prof. Max Wiegand to Frau Emma Wiegand.</span></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, December 21.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Emma</span>—The ticket is not to be found either
in the wardrobe or in the desk. Perhaps it slipped
out when you were packing, and was thrown away.
I can think of no other explanation.</p>

<p>To-morrow or next day I will again go to Herr
Palaschke, and try to wheedle him out of my property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_946">[Pg 946]</span>
by all possible blandishments and assurances, but to-day
I am confined to my room, for my cold has resulted
in a severe attack of neuralgia.</p>

<p>I had a dreadful scene with the cook yesterday. On
the day of your departure she gave me notice, and
when I tried to persuade her to remain she turned on
me and told me in a very insolent manner that I knew
nothing about housekeeping, and that it was only out
of sympathy for you, dear Emma, that she had so long
remained with us at such low wages, and that she
should leave immediately. I answered calmly, but
firmly, that she must stay till the end of her engagement.
Then she began to cry and storm, and at last
was so outrageously impertinent as to declare that even
<em>you</em> could not manage to live with me. I lost my temper
and must, I suppose, have called her an “impudent
woman,” though I can not remember saying it. Unfortunately
for me I have had no experience in dealing
with viragos.</p>

<p>Two hours later, after supper, I rang and discovered
that she was already gone, bag and baggage, leaving
in the kitchen a badly spelled <em>billet doux</em>, in which
she threatened me with a lawsuit for calling her an
“impudent woman,” in case I should refuse to give her
a certificate of character.</p>

<p>I am now entirely without servants. The porter’s
wife blacks my shoes for a handsome consideration,
and brings me from the café meals which ought to be
condemned by the health inspector. As you have truly
remarked, it will be impossible to replace these women
before the New Year, but I have already written to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_947">[Pg 947]</span>
dozen employment bureaus, and will go myself as soon
as I am able to leave the house. This has grown into
a long letter, my dear Emma, but when the heart is
full the pen runs rapidly.</p>

<p>I also suspect that abominable cook of taking my
gold sleeve buttons—those left me by Uncle Friedrich—though
I have, of course, no proof. Have you any
idea where they are? If so please drop me a line.
Good-by, my dear Emma, and I trust you are more
comfortable than I am.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;">Your <span class="smcap">Max</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Frau Emma Wiegand to Prof. Max Wiegand.</span></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Freiburg</span>, December 23.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Max</span>—I have read with much sympathy your
account of your little mishaps and annoyances. The
cook often spoke to me very much as she did to you,
but I put up with it because she is a good cook, and
only cooks who know nothing are polite. Now you
see what I have had to stand for years, and that there
are problems in that department also which can not be
solved by natural science.</p>

<p>I can not, at this distance, advise you what to do,
and should not consider myself justified in doing so
now that our intimate relations have been terminated
in so dignified a manner, as you so truly remark in
your first letter. As for the furrier’s ticket and the
sleeve buttons, I will wager that I could find them both
in five minutes. You <em>must</em> remember how often you
have hunted in vain for a thing which I have found
at the first attempt. Men occasionally discover a new
truth but never an old button.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_948">[Pg 948]</span></p>

<p>Since a correspondence has been begun by you, I
have a little request to make. I forgot before I left
to ask you for the letters which you wrote me during
our engagement, and which at my request you put in
your safe. They are my property, and I should like
to have them as a reminder of happier days. Will you
be so kind as to send them to me?</p>

<p>Wishing you a Merry Christmas,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Emma</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Prof. Max Wiegand to Frau Emma Wiegand</span>.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, December 25.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Emma</span>—Your kind wish that I might
have a Merry Christmas has not been fulfilled. I
never spent so melancholy a Christmas Eve. You will
not wonder that I could not bear to accept the invitations
of friends—to be a looker-on at family rejoicings—so
I stayed at home, entirely alone. I found it utterly
impossible to get a servant before New Year’s,
and yesterday was even without a helper from outside.
The porter’s wife put a cold supper on the table for
me early in the afternoon, for she was too busy
later with Christmas preparations for her children.
A smoky oil lamp took the place of the Christmas tree
which you always adorned so charmingly and with
such exquisite taste every year, and there were none
of those pretty surprises by which you supplied my
wants and wishes almost before I was conscious of
them. There was nothing on the Christmas table but
my old fur coat, which Herr Palaschke—softened by
my entreaties and assurances and perhaps also by the
spirit of Christmastide—had allowed me to take the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_949">[Pg 949]</span>
preceding day. It was as cold as charity in the room,
for the fire had gone out and it was beyond my skill
to rekindle it, so I put on the fur coat, sat down by
the smoky lamp, and read over the letters which I
wrote you during the time of our engagement and
which I had taken from their eleven years’ resting-place
to send to you to-day.</p>

<p>Dear Emma, I can not tell you how they have moved
me. I cried like a child, not over the tragic ending of
our marriage alone, but at the change in myself which
I recognize. They are very immature and in many
ways not in accordance with my present way of thinking,
but what a fresh, frank, warm-blooded fellow I
was then, and how I loved you! How happy I was!
How artlessly and unreservedly did I give myself up
to my happiness! Till now I have thought that there
has been a gradual, slow change in you alone, but now
I see that I also have altered, and God knows, when I
compare the Max of those days with the Max of to-day,
I do not know to which to give the preference.
In the sleepless nights which I have lately spent, I
have thought over the possibility of transforming myself
into the Max I then was, and grave doubts have
suggested themselves whether the differences in our
views of matters and things were really as great as
they seemed to us, whether there is not outside of
them something eternally human, some neutral ground
where we might continue to have interests in common.</p>

<p>Try and see, dear Emma, whether such a voice does
not speak also to your soul. We can not undo the
past, but nothing could give me greater consolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_950">[Pg 950]</span>
in my present unhappy condition than to know that
you could say yes to this question, for your departure
has left a void in my house and in my life that I can
never, never fill.</p>

<p>Thy most unhappy<br>
 <span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 2em;">Max</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Frau Emma Wiegand to Prof. Max Wiegand.</span></p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Freiburg</span>, December 27.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Max</span>—I very willingly gave you information
as long as it related only to tickets and sleeve buttons,
but I must decline answering the question contained
in your last letter. Did you really believe, you old
Pedant, that I left your home—which was also mine—because
we disagreed in our views of matters and
things in general? Then you are mightily mistaken.
I left you because I saw more plainly every day that
you no longer loved me. Yes, I had become a burden
to you—you wanted to get rid of me. If in that dignified
parting scene you had said one single tender
word to me, I should probably have stayed, but, as
usual, you were on your high horse, from which you
have now had so lamentable a tumble just because your
servants have left you. <em>I</em> too have served you faithfully,
though you do not seem to have recognized that
fact. <em>I</em> never let the fire go out on your hearth. It
was not <em>my</em> fault when it grew cold.</p>

<p>Who knows whether you would have noticed the
void left by my going if your fur coat had not also
been missing? This gave you an opportunity of opening
a correspondence with me, and it seems to be only
fitting that it should now close, since you have once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_951">[Pg 951]</span>
more regained possession of your property. I, at least,
have nothing more to say.</p>

<p>Good-by forever,<br>
<span class="smcap" style="padding-right: 2em;">Emma</span>.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, January 8.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gustav</span>—I have a great piece of news to tell
you. My wife returned to me yesterday, and at my
earnest solicitation. I thought I could no longer live
<em>with</em> her, but I find it equally impossible to live <em>without</em>
her. I have just discovered that she too was very unhappy
during the time of our separation, but she would
never have acknowledged it, for her’s is the stronger
character of the two. I do not know how to explain
the miracle, but we love each other more dearly than
ever. We are celebrating a new honeymoon. The
great questions of life drove us apart, but is it only
the little ones which have reunited us? Would you
suppose that one could find a half-desiccated heart in
the pocket of an old fur coat? The stately edifice of
my worldly knowledge totters on its foundations, dear
Gustav. I have a great deal to unlearn.</p>

<p><em>This Viennese dramatist, whose status as
an author is still in the balance, was born in
1862. He studied medicine at the University
of Vienna and afterward assisted his father
at the Vienna General Polytechnic. At his
father’s death, in 1893, he gave up medicine
as a profession and began his literary career
with a volume of poems.</em></p>

<p><em>Schnitzler has the dramatic feeling in all that
he writes—from his earliest poems, through
his short stories, to his dramas proper, one
of the most popular of which, “The Green
Parrot,” was acted in French with great success
at the Théâtre Antoine in Paris in 1907.
Of his novels, one of the latest is “Lieutenant
Gustl,” published in 1900. His talent, however,
is not yet formed—it is in a tentative
state, grotesque, realistic, sentimental—but it
will not remain so long, if it can produce many
more such admirable stories as “The Dead

<p>He could endure the quiet waiting in the carriage
no longer; it was easier to get out and
walk up and down. It was now dark; the
few scattered lamps in the narrow side street quivered
uneasily in the wind. The rain had stopped, the sidewalks
were almost dry, but the rough-paved roadway
was still moist, and little pools gleamed here and there.</p>

<p>“Strange, isn’t it?” thought Franz. “Here we are
scarcely a hundred paces from the Prater, and yet it
might be a street in some little country town. Well,
it’s safe enough, at any rate. She won’t meet any of
the friends she dreads so much here.”</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. “Only just seven, and so
dark already! It is an early autumn this year ...
and then this confounded storm!...” He turned his
coat-collar up about his neck and quickened his pacing.
The glass in the street lamps rattled lightly.</p>

<p>“Half an hour more,” he said to himself, “then I
can go home. I could almost wish—that that half-hour
were over.” He stood for a moment on the corner,
where he could command a view of both streets.
“She’ll surely come to-day,” his thoughts ran on, while
he struggled with his hat, which threatened to blow
away. “It’s Friday.... Faculty meeting at the University;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_956">[Pg 956]</span>
she needn’t hurry home.” He heard the clanging
of street-car gongs, and the hour chimed from a
nearby church tower. The street became more animated.
Hurrying figures passed him, clerks of neighboring
shops; they hastened onward, fighting against
the storm. No one noticed him; a couple of half-grown
girls glanced up in idle curiosity as they went
by. Suddenly he saw a familiar figure coming toward
him. He hastened to meet her.... Could it be she?
On foot?</p>

<p>She saw him, and quickened her pace.</p>

<p>“You are walking?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I dismissed the cab in front of the theatre. I think
I’ve had that driver before.”</p>

<p>A man passed them, turning to look at the lady.
Her companion glared at him, and the other passed on
hurriedly. The lady looked after him. “Who was it?”
she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Don’t know him. We’ll see no one we know here,
don’t worry. But come now, let’s get into the cab.”</p>

<p>“Is that your carriage?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“An open one?”</p>

<p>“It was warm and pleasant when I engaged it an
hour ago.”</p>

<p>They walked to the carriage; the lady stepped in.</p>

<p>“Driver!” called the man;</p>

<p>“Why, where is he?” asked the lady.</p>

<p>Franz looked around. “Well, did you ever? I don’t
see him anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Oh—” her tone was low and timid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_957">[Pg 957]</span></p>

<p>“Wait a moment, child, he must be around here
somewhere.”</p>

<p>The young man opened the door of a little saloon,
and discovered his driver at a table with several others.
The man rose hastily. “In a minute, sir,” he explained,
swallowing his glass of wine.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by this?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.... Be there in a minute.” His
step was a little unsteady as he hastened to his horses.
“Where’ll you go, sir?”</p>

<p>“Prater—Summer-house.”</p>

<p>Franz entered the carriage. His companion sat back
in a corner, crouching fearsomely under the shadow of
the cover.</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his. She sat silent.
“Won’t you say good evening to me?”</p>

<p>“Give me a moment to rest, dear. I’m still out of
breath.”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his corner. Neither spoke for
some minutes. The carriage turned into the Prater
street, passed the Tegethoff Monument, and a few minutes
later was rolling swiftly through the broad, dark
Prater Avenue.</p>

<p>Emma turned suddenly and flung both arms around
her lover’s neck. He lifted the veil that still hung
about her face, and kissed her.</p>

<p>“I have you again—at last!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Do you know how long it is since we have seen each
other?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Since Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that wasn’t good for much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_958">[Pg 958]</span></p>

<p>“Why not? You were in our house.”</p>

<p>“Yes—in your house. That’s just it. This can’t go
on. I shall not enter your house again.... What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“A carriage passed us.”</p>

<p>“Dear girl, the people who are driving in the Prater
at such an hour, and in such weather, aren’t noticing
much what other people are doing.”</p>

<p>“Yes—that’s so. But some one might look in here,
by chance.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t be recognized. It’s too dark.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but can’t we drive somewhere else?”</p>

<p>“Just as you like.” He called to the driver, who did
not seem to hear. Franz leaned forward and touched
the man.</p>

<p>“Turn around again. What are you whipping your
horses like that for? We’re in no hurry, I tell you.
Drive—let me see—yes—drive down the avenue that
leads to the Reichs Bridge.”</p>

<p>“The Reichs-strasse?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But don’t hurry so, there’s no need of it.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. But it’s the wind that makes the
horses so crazy.”</p>

<p>Franz sat back again as the carriage turned in the
other direction.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t I see you yesterday?”</p>

<p>“How could I?”...</p>

<p>“You were invited to my sister’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh—yes.”</p>

<p>“Why weren’t you there?”</p>

<p>“Because I can’t be with you—like that—with others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_959">[Pg 959]</span>
around. No, I just can’t.” She shivered. “Where are
we now?” she asked, after a moment.</p>

<p>They were passing under the railroad bridge at the
entrance to the Reichs-strasse.</p>

<p>“On the way to the Danube,” replied Franz. “We’re
driving toward the Reichs Bridge. We’ll certainly not
meet any of our friends here,” he added, with a touch
of mockery.</p>

<p>“The carriage jolts dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“We’re on cobblestones again.”</p>

<p>“But he drives so crooked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you only think so.”</p>

<p>He had begun to notice himself that the vehicle was
swaying to and fro more than was necessary, even on
the rough pavement. But he said nothing, not wishing
to alarm her.</p>

<p>“There’s a great deal I want to say to you to-day,
Emma.”</p>

<p>“You had better begin then; I must be home at nine
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“A few words may decide everything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness, what was that!” she screamed. The
wheels had caught in a car-track, and the carriage
turned partly over as the driver attempted to free it.
Franz caught at the man’s coat. “Stop that!” he cried.
“Why, you’re drunk, man!”</p>

<p>The driver halted his horses with some difficulty.
“Oh, no—sir—”</p>

<p>“Let’s get out here, Emma, and walk.”</p>

<p>“Where are we?”</p>

<p>“Here’s the bridge already. And the wind is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_960">[Pg 960]</span>
nearly as strong as it was. It will be nicer to walk a
little. It’s so hard to talk in the carriage.”</p>

<p>Emma drew down her veil and followed him.
“Don’t you call this windy?” she exclaimed as she
struggled against the gust that met her at the corner.</p>

<p>He took her arm, and called to the driver to follow
them.</p>

<p>They walked on slowly. Neither spoke as they
mounted the ascent of the bridge; and they halted
where they could hear the flow of the water below
them. Heavy darkness surrounded them. The broad
stream stretched itself out in gray, indefinite outlines;
red lights in the distance, floating above the water,
awoke answering gleams from its surface. Trembling
stripes of light reached down from the shore they had
just left; on the other side of the bridge the river lost
itself in the blackness of open fields. Thunder rumbled
in the distance; they looked over to where the red
lights soared. A train with lighted windows rolled
between iron arches that seemed to spring up out of
the night for an instant, to sink back into darkness
again. The thunder grew fainter and more distant;
silence fell again; only the wind moved, in sudden
gusts.</p>

<p>Franz spoke at last, after a long silence. “We must
go away.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Emma answered, softly.</p>

<p>“We must go away,” he continued, with more animation.
“Go away altogether, I mean—”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t!”</p>

<p>“Only because we are cowards, Emma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_961">[Pg 961]</span></p>

<p>“And my child?”</p>

<p>“He will let you have the boy, I know.”</p>

<p>“But how shall we go?” Her voice was very low.
“You mean—to run away—”</p>

<p>“Not at all. You have only to be honest with him;
to tell him that you can not live with him any longer;
that you belong to me.”</p>

<p>“Franz—are you mad?”</p>

<p>“I will spare you that trial, if you wish. I will tell
him myself.”</p>

<p>“No, Franz, you will do nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>He endeavored to read her face. But the darkness
showed him only that her head was turned toward him.</p>

<p>He was silent a few moments more. Then he spoke
quietly: “You need not fear; I shall not do it.”</p>

<p>They walked toward the farther shore. “Don’t you
hear a noise?” she asked. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Something is coming from the other side,” he said.</p>

<p>A slow rumbling came out of the darkness. A little
red light gleamed out at them. They could see that it
hung from the axle of a clumsy country cart, but they
could not see whether the cart was laden or not, and
whether there were human beings on it. Two other
carts followed the first. They could just see the outlines
of a man in peasant garb on the last cart, and could see
that he was lighting his pipe. The carts passed them
slowly. Soon there was nothing to be heard but the
low rolling of the wheels as their own carriage followed
them. The bridge dropped gently to the farther
shore. They saw the street disappear into blackness
between rows of trees. Open fields lay before them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_962">[Pg 962]</span>
the right and to the left; they gazed out into gloom
indistinguishable.</p>

<p>There was another long silence before Franz spoke
again. “Then it is the last time—”</p>

<p>“What?—” Emma’s tone was anxious.</p>

<p>“The last time we are to be together. Stay with
him, if you will. I bid you farewell.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“There, now you see, it is you who always spoil the
few hours we have together?—not I.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right,” said Franz. “Let’s drive back
to town.”</p>

<p>She held his arm closer. “No,” she insisted, tenderly,
“I don’t want to go back. I won’t be sent away
from you.”</p>

<p>She drew his head down to hers and kissed him tenderly.
“Where would we get to if we drove on down
there?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That’s the road to Prague, dear.”</p>

<p>“We won’t go quite that far,” she smiled, “but I’d
like to drive on a little, down there.” She pointed
into the darkness.</p>

<p>Franz called to the driver. There was no answer;
the carriage rumbled on, slowly. Franz ran after it,
and saw that the driver was fast asleep. Franz roused
him roughly. “We want to drive on down that street.
Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>Emma entered the carriage first, then Franz. The
driver whipped his horses, and they galloped madly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_963">[Pg 963]</span>
over the moist earth of the road-bed. The couple
inside the cab held each other closely as they swayed
with the motion of the vehicle.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this quite nice?” whispered Emma, her lips
on his.</p>

<p>In the moment of her words she seemed to feel the
cab mounting into the air. She felt herself thrown
over violently, reached for some hold, but grasped
only the empty air. She seemed to be spinning madly
like a top, her eyes closed; suddenly she found herself
lying on the ground, a great silence about her, as if
she were alone, far away from all the world. Then
noises began to come into her consciousness again;
hoofs beat the ground near her; a low moaning came
from somewhere; but she could see nothing. Terror
seized her; she screamed aloud. Her terror grew
stronger, for she could not hear her own voice. Suddenly
she knew what had happened; the carriage had
hit some object, possibly a milestone; had upset, and
she had been thrown out. Where is Franz? was her
next thought. She called his name. And now she
could hear her voice, not distinctly yet, but she could
hear it. There was no answer to her call. She tried
to get up. After some effort she rose to a sitting posture,
and, reaching out, she felt something, a human
body, on the ground beside her. She could now begin
to see a little through the dimness. Franz lay beside
her, motionless. She put out her hand and touched
his face; something warm and wet covered it. Her
heart seemed to stop beating—Blood?—Oh, what had
happened? Franz was wounded and unconscious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_964">[Pg 964]</span>
Where was the coachman? She called him, but no
answer came. She still sat there on the ground. She
did not seem to be injured, although she ached all over.
“What shall I do?” she thought; “what shall I do?
How can it be that I am not injured? Franz!” she
called again. A voice answered from somewhere
near her.</p>

<p>“Where are you, lady? And where is the gentleman?
Wait a minute, Miss—I’ll light the lamps, so
we can see. I don’t know what’s got into the beasts
to-day. It ain’t my fault, Miss, sure—they ran into
a pile of stones.”</p>

<p>Emma managed to stand up, although she was
bruised all over. The fact that the coachman seemed
quite uninjured reassured her somewhat. She heard
the man opening the lamp and striking a match. She
waited anxiously for the light. She did not dare to
touch Franz again. “It’s all so much worse when you
can’t see plainly,” she thought. “His eyes may be open
now—there won’t be anything wrong....”</p>

<p>A tiny ray of light came from one side. She saw
the carriage, not completely upset, as she had thought,
but leaning over toward the ground, as if one wheel
were broken. The horses stood quietly. She saw the
milestone, then a heap of loose stones, and beyond them
a ditch. Then the light touched Franz’s feet, crept up
over his body to his face, and rested there. The coachman
had set the lamp on the ground beside the head of
the unconscious man. Emma dropped to her knees,
and her heart seemed to stop beating as she looked
into the face before her. It was ghastly white; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_965">[Pg 965]</span>
eyes were half open, only the white showing. A thin
stream of blood trickled down from one temple and
ran into his collar. The teeth were fastened into the
under lip. “No—no—it isn’t possible,” Emma spoke,
as if to herself.</p>

<p>The driver knelt also and examined the face of the
man. Then he took the head in both his hands and
raised it. “What are you doing?” screamed Emma,
hoarsely, shrinking back at the sight of the head that
seemed to be rising of its own volition.</p>

<p>“Please, Miss—I’m afraid—I’m thinking—there’s a
great misfortune happened—”</p>

<p>“No—no—it’s not true!” said Emma. “It can’t be
true!— You are not hurt? Nor am I—”</p>

<p>The man let the head he held fall back again into the
lap of the trembling Emma. “If only some one would
come—if the peasants had only passed fifteen minutes
later.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Emma, her lips
trembling.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, Miss, if the carriage was all right—but
it’s no good as it is—we’ve got to wait till some
one comes—” he talked on, but Emma did not hear
him. Her brain seemed to awake suddenly, and she
knew what was to be done. “How far is it to the
nearest house?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not much further, Miss—there’s Franz-Josefsland
right there. We’d see the houses if it was lighter—it
won’t take five minutes to get there.”</p>

<p>“Go there, then; I’ll stay here— Go and fetch
some one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_966">[Pg 966]</span></p>

<p>“I think I’d better stay here with you, Miss. Somebody
must come; it’s the main road.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be too late; we need a doctor at once.”</p>

<p>The coachman looked down at the quiet face, then
he looked at Emma, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss—but there’ll be no doctor in those
houses.”</p>

<p>“But there’ll be somebody to send to the city—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Miss—they’ll be having a telephone there,
anyway! We’ll telephone to the Rescue Society.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s it. Go at once, run—and bring
some men back with you. Why do you wait? Go at
once. Hurry!”</p>

<p>The man looked down again at the white face in
her lap. “There’ll be no use here for doctor or Rescue
Society, Miss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go!—for God’s sake go!”</p>

<p>“I’m going, Miss—but don’t get afraid in the darkness
here.”</p>

<p>He hurried down the street. “’Twasn’t my fault,”
he murmured as he ran. “Such an idea! to drive down
this road this time o’ night.”</p>

<p>Emma was left alone with the unconscious man in
the gloomy street.</p>

<p>“What shall I do now?” she thought. “It can’t be
possible—it can’t.” The thought circled dizzily in her
brain—“It can’t be possible.” Suddenly she seemed
to hear a low breathing. She bent to the pale lips—no—not
the faintest breath came from them. The
blood had dried on temple and cheek. She gazed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_967">[Pg 967]</span>
the eyes, the half-closed eyes, and shuddered. Why
couldn’t she believe it?... It must be true—this
was Death! A shiver ran through her—she felt but
one thing—“This is a corpse. I am here alone with
a corpse!—a corpse that rests on my lap!” With trembling
hands she pushed the head away, until it rested
on the ground. Then a feeling of horrible aloneness
came over her. Why had she sent the coachman away?
What should she do here all alone with this dead man
in the darkness? If only some one would come—but
what was she to do then if anybody did come? How
long would she have to wait here? She looked down
at the corpse again. “But I’m not alone with him,”
she thought, “the light is there.” And the light seemed
to her to become alive, something sweet and friendly,
to which she owed gratitude. There was more life in
this little flame than in all the wide night about her.
It seemed almost as if this light was a protection for
her, a protection against the terrible pale man who lay
on the ground beside her. She stared into the light
until her eyes wavered and the flame began to dance.
Suddenly she felt herself awake—wide awake. She
sprang to her feet. Oh, this would not do! It would
not do at all—no one must find her here with him.
She seemed to be outside of herself, looking at herself
standing there on the road, the corpse and the light
below her; she saw herself grow into strange, enormous
proportions, high up into the darkness. “What
am I waiting for?” she asked herself, and her brain
reeled. “What am I waiting for? The people who
might come? They don’t need me. They will come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_968">[Pg 968]</span>
and they will ask questions—and I—why am I here?
They will ask who I am—what shall I answer? I will
not answer them—I will not say a word—they can not
compel me to talk.”</p>

<p>The sound of voices came from the distance.</p>

<p>“Already?” she thought, listening in terror. The
voices came from the bridge. It could not be the men
the driver was bringing with him. But whoever it was
would see the light—and they must not see it, for then
she would be discovered. She overturned the lantern
with her foot, and the light went out. She stood in
utter darkness. She could see nothing—not even him.
The pile of stones shone dimly. The voices came
nearer. She trembled from head to foot; they must
not find her here. That was the only thing of real
importance in all the wide world—that no one should
find her here. She would be lost if they knew that
this—this corpse—was her lover. She clasps her hands
convulsively, praying that the people, whoever they
were, might pass by on the farther side of the road,
and not see her. She listens breathless. Yes, they are
there, on the other side—women, two women, or perhaps
three. What are they talking about? They have
seen the carriage, they speak of it—she can distinguish
words. “A carriage upset—” What else do they say?
She can not understand—they walk on—they have
passed her—Ah—thanks—thanks to Heaven!—And
now? What now? Oh, why isn’t she dead, as he
is? He is to be envied; there is no more danger, no
more fear for him. But so much—so much for her
to tremble for. She shivers at the thought of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_969">[Pg 969]</span>
found here, of being asked, “Who are you?” She will
have to go to the police station, and all the world will
know about it—her husband—her child. She can not
understand why she has stood there motionless so long.
She need not stay here—she can do no good here—and
she is only courting disaster for herself. She
makes a step forward—Careful! the ditch is here—she
crosses it—how wet it is—two paces more and she
is in the middle of the street. She halts a moment,
looks straight ahead, and can finally distinguish the
gray line of the road leading onward into darkness.
There—over there—lies the city. She can not see it,
but she knows the way. She turns once more. It does
not seem so dark now. She can see the carriage and
the horses quite distinctly—and, looking hard, she
seems to see the outline of a human body on the
ground. Her eyes open wide. Something seems to
clutch at her and hold her here—it is he—she feels
his power to keep her with him. With an effort she
frees herself. Then she perceives that it was the soft
mud of the road that held her. And she walks onward—faster—faster—her
pace quickens to a run. Only to
be away from here, to be back in the light—in the
noise—among men. She runs along the street, raising
her skirt high, that her steps may not be hindered.
The wind is behind her, and seems to push her along.
She does not know what it is she flees from. Is it the
pale man back there by the ditch? No, now she knows,
she flees the living, not the dead, the living who will
soon be there, and who will look for her. What will
they think? Will they follow her? But they can not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_970">[Pg 970]</span>
catch up with her now, she is so far away, she is
nearing the bridge, there is no danger. No one can
know who she was, no one can possibly imagine who
the woman was who drove down through the country
road with the dead man. The driver does not know
her; he would not recognize her if he should ever see
her again. They will not take the trouble to find out
who she is. Who cares? It was wise of her not to
stay—and it was not cowardly either. Franz himself
would say it was wise. She must go home; she has a
husband, a child; she would be lost if any one should
see her there with her dead lover. There is the bridge;
the street seems lighter—she hears the water beneath
her. She stands there, where they stood together, arm
in arm—when was it? How many hours ago? It can
not be long since then. And yet—perhaps she lay unconscious
long, and it is midnight now, or near morning,
and they have missed her at home. Oh, no—it is
not possible. She knows that she was not unconscious,
she remembers everything clearly. She runs across the
bridge, shivering at the sound of her own steps. Now
she sees a figure coming toward her; she slows her
pace. It is a man in uniform. She walks more slowly,
she does not want to attract attention. She feels the
man’s eyes resting on her—suppose he stops her! Now
he is quite near; it is a policeman. She walks calmly
past him, and hears him stop behind her. With an
effort she continues in the same slow pace. She hears
the jingle of street-car bells—ah, it can not be midnight
yet. She walks more quickly—hurrying toward the
city, the lights of which begin there by the railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_971">[Pg 971]</span>
viaduct—the growing noise tells her how near she is.
One lonely stretch of street, and then she is safe. Now
she hears a shrill whistle coming rapidly nearer—a
wagon flies swiftly past her. She stops and looks after
it; it is the ambulance of the Rescue Society. She
knows where it is going. “How quickly they have
come,” she thinks; “it is like magic.” For a moment
she feels that she must call to them, must go back with
them. Shame, terrible, overwhelming shame, such as
she has never known before, shakes her from head to
foot—she knows how vile, how cowardly she is. Then,
as the whistle and the rumble of wheels fade away in
the distance, a mad joy takes hold of her. She is saved—saved!
She hurries on; she meets more people, but
she does not fear them—the worst is over. The noise
of the city grows louder, the street is lighter, the skyline
of the Prater street rises before her, and she knows
that she can sink into a flood tide of humanity there
and lose herself in it. When she comes to a street
lamp she is quite calm enough now to take out her
watch and look at it. It is ten minutes to nine. She
holds the watch to her ear—it is ticking merrily. And
she thinks: “Here I am, alive, unharmed—and he—he—dead.
It is Fate.” She feels as if all had been forgiven—as
if she had never sinned. And what if Fate
had willed otherwise? If it were she lying there in
the ditch, and he who remained alive? He would not
have run away—but then he is a man. She is only a
woman, she has a husband, a child—it was her right—her
duty—to save herself. She knows that it was not
a sense of duty that impelled her to do it. But what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_972">[Pg 972]</span>
she has done was right—she had done right instinctively—as
all good people do. If she had stayed she
would have been discovered by this time. The doctors
would question her. And all the papers would report
it next morning; she would have been ruined forever,
and yet her ruin could not bring him back to life. Yes,
that was the main point, her sacrifice would have been
all in vain. She crosses under the railway bridge and
hurries on. There is the Tegethoff Column, where so
many streets meet. There are but few people in the
park on this stormy evening, but to her it seems as if
the life of the city was roaring about her. It was so
horribly still back there. She had plenty of time now.
She knows that her husband will not be home before
ten o’clock. She will have time to change her clothes.
And then it occurs to her to look at her gown. She
is horrified to see how soiled it is. What shall she say
to the maid about it? And next morning the papers
will all bring the story of the accident, and they will
tell of a woman who had been in the carriage, and
who had run away. She trembled afresh. One single
carelessness and she is lost, even now. But she has
her latch-key with her; she can let herself in; no one
will hear her come. She jumps into a cab and is about
to give her address, then suddenly she remembers that
this would not be wise. She gives any number that
occurs to her.</p>

<p>As she drives through the Prater street she wishes
that she might feel something—grief—horror—but she
can not. She has but one thought, one desire—to be
at home, in safety. All else is indifferent to her. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_973">[Pg 973]</span>
she had decided to leave him alone, dead, by the roadside—in
that moment everything seemed to have died
within her, everything that would mourn and grieve
for him. She has no feeling but that of fear for herself.
She is not heartless—she knows that the day will
come when her sorrow will be despair—it may kill her
even. But she knows nothing now, except the desire
to sit quietly at home, at the supper table with her
husband and child. She looks out through the cab
window. She is driving through the streets of the
inner city. It is brilliantly light here, and many
people hurry past. Suddenly all that she has experienced
in the last few hours seems not to be true, it is
like an evil dream; not something real, irreparable.
She stops her cab in one of the side streets of the
Ring, gets out, turns a corner quickly, and takes
another carriage, giving her own address this time.
She does not seem able to think of anything any more.
“Where is he now?” She closes her eyes and sees him
on the litter, in the ambulance. Suddenly she feels
that he is here beside her. The cab sways, she feels
the terror of being thrown out again, and she screams
aloud. The cab halts before the door of her home.
She dismounts hastily, hurries with light steps through
the house door, unseen by the concierge, runs up the
stairs, opens her apartment door very gently, and slips
unseen into her own room. She undresses hastily,
hiding the mud-stained clothes in her cupboard. To-morrow,
when they are dry, she can clean them herself.
She washes hands and face, and slips into a loose
housegown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_974">[Pg 974]</span></p>

<p>The bell rings. She hears the maid open the door,
she hears her husband’s voice, and the rattle of his
cane on the hat-stand. She feels she must be brave
now or it will all have been in vain. She hurries to
the dining-room, entering one door as her husband
comes in at the other.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re home already?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” she replies, “I have been home some
time.”</p>

<p>“They evidently didn’t hear you come in.”</p>

<p>She smiles without effort. But it fatigues her horribly
to have to smile. He kisses her forehead.</p>

<p>The little boy is already at his place by the table.
He has been waiting some time, and has fallen asleep,
his head resting on an open book. She sits down beside
him; her husband takes his chair opposite, takes up a
paper, and glances carelessly at it. Then he says: “The
others are still talking away there.”</p>

<p>“What about?” she asks.</p>

<p>And he begins to tell her about the meeting, at
length. Emma pretends to listen, and nods now and
then. But she does not hear what he is saying, she
feels dazed, like one who has escaped terrible danger
as by a miracle; she can feel only this: “I am safe;
I am at home.” And while her husband is talking
she pulls her chair nearer the boy’s and lifts his head
to her shoulder. Fatigue inexpressible comes over her.
She can no longer control herself; she feels that her
eyes are closing, that she is dropping asleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly another possibility presents itself to her
mind, a possibility that she had dismissed the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_975">[Pg 975]</span>
she turned to leave the ditch where she had fallen.
Suppose he were not dead! Suppose—oh, but it is
impossible—his eyes—his lips—not a breath came
from them! But there are trances that are like death,
which deceive even practised eyes, and she knows
nothing about such things. Suppose he is still alive—suppose
he has regained consciousness and found
himself alone by the roadside—suppose he calls her
by her name? He might think she had been injured;
he might tell the doctors that there was a woman with
him, and that she must have been thrown to some distance.
They will look for her. The coachman will
come back with the men he has brought, and will tell
them that she was there, unhurt—and Franz will know
the truth. Franz knows her so well—he will know
that she has run away—and a great anger will come
over him. He will tell them her name in revenge. For
he is mortally injured, and it will hurt him cruelly that
she has left him alone in his last hour. He will say:
“That is Mrs. Emma ——. I am her lover. She is
cowardly and stupid, too, gentlemen, for she might
have known you would not ask her name; you would
be discreet; you would have let her go away unmolested.
Oh, she might at least have waited until you
came. But she is vile—utterly vile—ah!—”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asks the Professor, very
gravely, rising from his chair.</p>

<p>“What? What?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what is the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.” She presses the boy closer to her
breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_976">[Pg 976]</span></p>

<p>The Professor looks at her for a few minutes
steadily.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know that you had fallen asleep, and—”</p>

<p>“Well?— And—”</p>

<p>“And then you screamed out in your sleep.”</p>

<p>“Did I?”</p>

<p>“You screamed as if you were having a nightmare.
Were you dreaming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—”</p>

<p>And she sees her face in a mirror opposite, a face
tortured into a ghastly smile. She knows it is her own
face, and it terrifies her. She sees that it is frozen;
that this hideous smile is frozen on it, and will always
be there, all her life. She tries to cry out. Two hands
are laid on her shoulders, and between her own face
and the mirrored one her husband’s face pushes its way
in; his eyes pierce into hers. She knows that unless
she is strong for this last trial all is lost. And she
feels that she is strong; she has regained control of
her limbs, but the moment of strength is short. She
raises her hands to his, which rest on her shoulders;
she draws him down to her, and smiles naturally and
tenderly into his eyes.</p>

<p>She feels his lips on her forehead, and she thinks:
“It is all a dream—he will never tell—he will never
take revenge like that—he is dead—really dead—and
the dead are silent—”</p>

<p>“Why did you say that?” she hears her husband’s
voice suddenly.</p>

<p>She starts. “What did I say?” And it seems to
her as if she had told everything, here at the table—aloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_977">[Pg 977]</span>
before every one—and again she asks, shuddering
before his horrified eyes, “What did I say?”</p>

<p>“The dead are silent.” her husband repeats very
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answers.</p>

<p>And she reads in his eyes that she can no longer
hide anything from him. They look long and silently
at each other. “Put the boy to bed,” he says at last.
“You have something to tell me, have you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes—”</p>

<p>She knows now that within a few moments she
will tell this man everything—this man, whom she
has deceived for many years.</p>

<p>And while she goes slowly through the door, holding
her boy, she feels her husband’s eyes still resting
on her, and a great peace comes over her, the assurance
that now many things would be right again.</p>

<p><em>Clara Viebig, foremost of the young women
writers of modern Germany, was born in the
early seventies, in the Eifel country of Prussia.
Her first book, “Daughters of the Rhineland,”
appeared in 1896, with a leaning toward
the new “woman movement.” But her first
great success was the novel, “Children of the
Eifel,” which introduced a new subject as well
as a new writer. It is the picture of a “stirring
prophet of doom in the midst of the smiling
Rhineland.” In dealing with nature, Clara
Viebig is masculine, yet when she deals with
the brutalities of nature, she is all womanly,
without flinching. The expectation raised by
these stories was justified in her next book,
“Our Daily Bread,” showing such keenness of
observation, strength of portraiture, loving insight,
and startling directness that it is considered
by many the best that newer German
literature has produced.</em></p>

<p>It was already autumn on the heights of the Eifel.
The cold winds blew in from the north, snorting
in malicious haste. They colored the thin grass
yellow, and tousled the gnarled firs and the trembling
birches. Down in the sunny Moselle Valley the roses
still bloomed in the gardens, in their glory of white,
red, and yellow petals. Heavily laden fruit trees
nodded over the crystal clear stream, the rich blood
swelled the grape, and walnut and chestnut trees burst
open the green coverings of their fruit and shook the
shining brown heart of it down upon the earth. But
up on the heights the nights smelt of winter already.
The sloes hung blue and tart on the blackthorn, cold
frost silvered the grass and the moss, and heavy mists
filled the ravines. It was inhospitably cold and unfriendly.
The Eifel with its treeless heights, its purple
moors, and its dark tarns made itself ready to receive
its stern master, the Winter.</p>

<p>Where the wood halts and only brush can grow, a
tiny hut clung to the rocks. It was a miserably poor
little nest with a low hanging roof of moss, on top of
which house-leek and other growing plants caught
foothold, even one saucy little pine tree had settled
down there. The door was low, the window covered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_982">[Pg 982]</span>with paper, but a contented white goat munched the
grass in front of the door, and a few weather-beaten
sunflowers nodded their heavy heads in fat condescension.</p>

<p>In this lonely hut, the poorest for many a mile, lived
the honest widow Anna Maria Balduin. She had lived
there many years, ever since the time, eighteen years
back, when she had entered it as the happy bride of
Peter Balduin, the sturdy woodchopper. Five years
later they had carried him out and buried him in the
little hill churchyard down in Kyllburg. That had
been a bad year. The potato crop was a failure, bread
rose in price, the famine fever ravished the Eifel, the
snow fell early, and hungry wolves crept down to the
outlying huts. In the widow’s little home the care for
daily bread, grief for the lost one, cold, and deprivation
were daily guests. The pale woman sat at her
spinning wheel and let the tears flow free, while her little
daughter Margret knelt beside her, laughing and
playing with pebbles, unheeding her mother’s sorrow.</p>

<p>Years had passed since then; the fresh grave had
fallen in and grass had grown over it, as over the
wounds of the heart. The little hut had grown more
dilapidated, and little Margret had become a tall girl.
She sat by the door spinning for her daily bread in the
service of the rich peasants’ wives, and had the goat
tied to her foot by a string, so that she could care for
it without stopping her work. Margret spun and spun,
looking up occasionally, aimlessly, or in unconscious
longing, at the sky above her, which domed pale blue
and unapproachably cool over the bare, rocky hilltops.</p>

</div>

<p>Her mother was very ill. For weeks and months
she had lain bent and stiff, drawn with rheumatic
pains, in the worm-eaten bed on her coarse pillows,
too helpless sometimes even to raise her hand to her
mouth. “It looks bad,” the wise woman from Kyllburg
had said, when after much entreaty and a payment
of fifty pfennigs (twelve and a half cents)
down she had been persuaded to climb up to the miserable
hut. She took away with her the widow’s one
hen, and left a magic medicine in its place. But the
medicine did no magic, the sick woman groaned and
moaned more than ever, and the screech owl, the bird
of death, screamed each midnight outside the window.</p>

<p>This was a particularly bad day. Pretty Margret
sat by the bedside with drooping head. Her busy
fingers continued to spin, but her usually laughing
brown eyes were filled with tears. She was a good
child, who had nothing in all the world but her mother
and her seventeen years. But her fresh youth was
blighted by the sorrow for her mother as the flowers
in May are smitten by hail.</p>

<p>It was a little brightening of the sadness when a
knock came on the door and a fat peasant woman
pushed herself over the threshold with sighs and
pantings.</p>

<p>“Praise be Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>“Forever and ever, amen.”</p>

<p>The visitor was a cousin from Kyllburg, Frau Margareta
Rindsfüsser, Margret’s godmother. She had
climbed up the mountain to see them, the good, kind
soul, even if she was a little too comfortably complete.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_984">[Pg 984]</span>
She unpacked a basket she carried on her arm: there
was sausage in it, rolls, chicory, and eggs.</p>

<p>“Well, Anna, how are the pains?”</p>

<p>“Bad, very bad.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” the visitor nodded, “I don’t believe myself
that you’ll be with us long. You’d better be
making ready for the blessed death.”</p>

<p>“O dear Lord Jesus,” moaned the sick woman, “I’d
be so glad to die—but it’s leaving Margret, and she so
young.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s true.” The visitor blinked her eyes and
blew her nose violently in her gay-colored handkerchief.
“It’s bitter hard, but there’s no help. Yet, if
you could get down to Trier to see the Sacred Coat,
that could help you.”</p>

<p>“Help her? The Sacred Coat?” Margret had
been listening with wide, open eyes; now she approached
and touched the visitor’s sleeve. “Auntie,
please tell me, what is the Sacred Coat?”</p>

<p>Frau Margareta Rindsfüsser crossed herself piously.
“Intercede for us, Sacred Coat, for forgiveness for our
sins—Why, girl, how stupid you are! Down there
in Trier the bells are ringing day and night, they are
ringing until the fish in the Moselle take fright. You’d
think you could hear the dingdonging even up here.
And people come from all over the world, up along
the Moselle, with crosses and banners, and they sing,
they pray to the Sacred Coat. My father’s brother’s
son, Stadtfeld’s Hanni, he’s been there. He told me
about it. He didn’t have no children, so he went down
there and touched the Sacred Coat with his wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_985">[Pg 985]</span>
ring; that helped. The priests in the Holy Cathedral,
they showed the Coat, and whoever is sick gets well
again. And if any one has somebody sick at home,
and takes something belonging to them with him, a
shirt, or a kerchief, or anything, the sick one will get
well again.”</p>

<p>“O blessed Lord Jesus!” the girl clasped her hands
as if in prayer. “Mother, I’ll go there.”</p>

<p>“It’s too far.” The sick woman sighed, half anxiously,
half longingly. “I can’t let you. You are my
only child—Something might happen. Jesus, Maria,
Joseph!”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, let me go. I’ve been down as far as
the Moselle with berries, and it’s just going a little
further; I can find Trier so easy. And if I pray many
thousand times to the Sacred Coat, then it will surely
help. And when I come back again, then you’re all
well. Oh, mother, just think!”</p>

<p>The girl caught the sick woman in her arms with
a laugh of joy. She pressed a fresh, blooming cheek
to her mother’s pale, hollow face. “Mother, say yes.
I’ll go down to pray to the Sacred Coat. I’ll go
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Anna, let her go, in God’s name, and the Holy
Virgin will be with her,” said the visitor. “I’ll come
up every day to look after the goat—and to look
after you.”</p>

<p>And she took her departure, much touched.</p>

<p>When evening came, Margret milked the goat and
got the supper. Then she stood at the well and
scrubbed herself as if she had not seen water for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_986">[Pg 986]</span>
week. The Sacred Coat could indeed demand that
one should be clean and bright from head to foot.
Then she went into the house and knelt before the
picture of the Virgin, which looked down, gay with
many colors, from out of its little gold frame on the
whitewashed wall. Her prayer was long and heart-felt.
It was not only the Paternoster and the Ave
that she prayed to-day—her tension, her expectations,
and secret anxieties for the coming day brought words
of her own in entreaty to her lips.</p>

<p>Then she sank down exhausted on her bed. Her
hands folded over her breast, she was soon breathing
the deep, regular breath of sweet, youthful sleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke, day was breaking already, and
the sun was shaking itself out of its morning dreams
behind rose-tipped clouds. It was high time to set
out.</p>

<p>Frau Anna wept as she saw her daughter standing
before her, fresh and rosy-cheeked, her black Sunday
dress pinned up over her blue underskirt, around her
slender throat the black cord with a tiny golden cross.
In one hand she held the bundle in which was her
mother’s shirt, which was to be offered to the Sacred
Coat, that the miracle might be performed. Furthermore,
there were her shining black shoes and her white
stockings, which she was to put on when she reached
the city gates. And also there was her godmother’s
present, the Sunday apron with its colored flowers,
Margret’s fairest possession, her greatest pride. But
there was nothing too good for the Sacred Coat.</p>

<p>The bright, young eyes gazed confidently into her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_987">[Pg 987]</span>
mother’s face. “Good-by—and when I come back,
then you’ll be well again.”</p>

<p>A clasp of the hand, the sign of the Cross on brow
and breast, a murmured blessing, a friendly nod—and
now she turned and stood on the threshold, and the
first golden rays of the sun kissed her fair, young
cheek.</p>

<p>Thus Margret’s pilgrimage began.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The birds twittered in the bushes, dewdrops hung
like diamonds on leaf and grass, as Margret sprang
light-footed down the hill slope. Down there in the
gray of the morning mists lay Kyllburg. The cocks
were crowing, but there was no smoke from the chimneys.
The people were still asleep. It must be nice to
live in Kyllburg, one was not so alone there as up on
the mountain. And evenings the girls could sit together
in the spinning-room and laugh and chat, each
with her sweetheart beside her. It must be nice to
have a sweetheart. Would she, little Margret, ever
have a sweetheart? Probably not. Mother said: “Poor
girls get no sweethearts.”</p>

<p>Hello! There was a big stone, and she nearly fell
over it. That comes of thinking about such stupid
things. What could a sweetheart matter to her? She
was poor little Margret from the cottage on the hill-top,
and she was going down to pray to the Sacred
Coat. She took her rosary from her pocket and let the
little balls roll busily through her fingers, as her rosy
lips murmured the prayers. That helped to shorten
the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_988">[Pg 988]</span></p>

<p>The wood grew denser, the crippled firs and meagre
birches gave place to slender beeches and stately oaks.
Bright colored flowers grew about in the grass, a
breath of warmth came into the air, and a brooklet
ran busily valleyward. How beautiful it was here!
Margret stood still and drew a deep breath. She had
come a long distance already, the sun stood noon-high.</p>

<p>Until now she had not met a human being, alone
with her angels had she wandered through the world.
But now from the distance there came a noise as of
many voices; a few paces more and she was out of the
forest, standing beside the broad turnpike road, on the
other side of which the Moselle flowed, calm and beautiful!
Like a silver ribbon the river wound itself
gently between the vine-clad banks, its ripples moved
softly, and the golden sun and the laughing blue sky
peeped down into the crystal mirror.</p>

<p>Margret’s face shone. There was the Moselle. Now
it could not be much farther. She must soon hear
the bells of Trier. And there, right in front of her,
came a solemn, stately procession, with waving banners.
The leader intoned a chant and sang the Ave,
and the chorus joined, many-voiced, in the refrain.
Margret crossed herself and stepped to one side.</p>

<p>How many people there were! She would have
liked to join them, but the women at the end of the
procession did not look amiable, and a pretty young
girl in a red petticoat gazed at her from head to foot
so sharply that her courage failed her. She waited
until they had all passed, then she followed at a little
distance as the procession crept slowly along the river-bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_989">[Pg 989]</span>
like a long, black caterpillar. With the entire
herd to point the way, the single lonely sheep can not
go wrong.</p>

<p>The sun burned hotly, the dust flew up in clouds;
hadn’t she come to Trier yet? Margret was hungry,
her feet hurt her. Wouldn’t it be better to put on her
shoes? But no, they must be kept bright and shining
for the city. So she trotted along the road that seemed
endless. A cherry tree and then an apple tree, and
then a cherry tree and an apple tree again, and now
and then a heap of stones and a milestone—how long
it was!</p>

<p>The train of pilgrims was some distance ahead;
Margret limped wearily after them. She would have
liked so much to rest a while by the wayside. But then
she would have lost sight of the procession, and that
would not do at all. So she took a piece of bread and
a bit of cheese from her bundle, and bit into it with
her strong, white teeth as she walked along.</p>

<p>The sun sank toward the skyline, the evening wove
its delicate veil over the river and the valley. High
above, the summits of the mountains still shone in
golden light, and tiny little cushiony clouds grew rosy
pink at their edges. Margret’s clear eyes grew tired,
her foot rose and fell more slowly. Oh, how nice it
would be to rest now, like the little birds that were
just slipping into their nests! There, listen! A deep
rich tone hummed through the air, and now another,
and another, and the wind brought other voices to her,
finer and thinner, that wove a lighter figure about the
single great voice. It was the bells of Trier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_990">[Pg 990]</span></p>

<p>The tired girl folded her hands a moment, then she
hurried joyfully onward. One more turn of the road
and there lay mighty Trier glowing in the evening
rays, which gleamed back from its gray roofs and
towers just across the bridge spanning the river with
stone arches.</p>

<p>And over the bridge the crowd pushed and swayed.
Walkers, alone or in groups, pressed hastily forward;
long lines of wagons rattled on in single file, many banners
waved in the evening wind. It was such a mighty
migration, such a crowding and hastening to get into
the Blessed City that the lonely maiden’s heart beat
heavy. No, she would not enter there yet, she would
rather spend the night out here, on this side of the
river, where there were not so many houses.</p>

<p>A solitary inn stood by the wayside, she decided to
enter there. Her hand sought for the few pennies in
her pocket. She had money, she could pay for her
night’s lodging, and she walked more quickly down
the little path that led to the inn door. But here she
nearly turned back again, such a rush and noise of
voices met her. From the open windows came the
sound of singing, shouting, and laughter. The wagons
were crowded in the courtyard, servants ran hastily
back and forth. She entered timidly, no one paid any
attention to her. She laid her little bundle down on
a still vacant seat at the end of a bench and sat down
beside it, holding it tightly in her hand. The noise and
the shouting made her dizzy. Not a place was unoccupied,
everybody seemed to be doing just about as he
liked. Here sat three men playing cards, two more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_991">[Pg 991]</span>
were quarreling, and had almost come to blows; in
another corner sat several telling their rosaries, and
one had already lain down on the straw and was snoring
aloud. There, in a corner, sat the pretty young
woman with the red petticoat whom Margret had seen
on the road. She was joking with a couple of young
men.</p>

<p>Would it be well to speak to her? She seemed quite
friendly. Margret approached her, timidly blushing:
“Were you going to Trier, to the Sacred Coat?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you stop here the night? I’d like to stay;”
Margret took her pennies out of her pocket. “Yes,
I can pay for it, but I’m scared, so alone.”</p>

<p>The stranger had listened quietly, then she pushed
at one of her companions, winked at the other, and
all three burst out into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“You can stay with me,” said one of the youths,
twisting his mustache ends upward; “then you won’t
be scared.”</p>

<p>He put out his hand toward Margret, but she
pushed him back, snatched her bundle, and ran out
of the door as quickly as a squirrel. She fled down
the street as if pursued. The noise from the inn had
long ceased behind her before she stopped, heavily
panting.</p>

<p>What should she do now? Go back into the inn to
all those many people, and the noise, and the screaming?
Oh, no. It were far better to stay out here
under God’s free heaven, where the stars looked down
on one like kind eyes, and the crickets chirped amiably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_992">[Pg 992]</span>
from the grass. Behind the bushes by the roadside
she saw a little straw hut, which probably belonged to
the overseer of the orchards. Margret peeped cautiously
into the little door; the hut was empty and half
falling to pieces. With a sigh of relief she crept in
under the low roof. She took out her last piece of
bread, and when she had eaten it she put her bundle
under her head, drew up her skirt over her shoulders,
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The sun stood shining and golden, well up in the
sky, when Margret woke out of her deep sleep. She
looked round, dazed; the preceding day seemed like
a dream to her, and she herself seemed to be a
stranger, some new and wonderful person. Yes, there
lay mighty Trier, there was the Moselle, there was the
inn from which she had fled—and she herself? Why,
yes, she was little Margret, who was going down to
pray to the Sacred Coat. It was high time to be up
and doing. Hastily she slipped down to the river-bank
behind a heavy thicket of willows where nobody could
see her. She laid aside her dress, bathed her face,
neck, and arms in the fresh, cool flood, and let the
clear ripples flow over her naked feet. She braided
up her long hair afresh, smoothing it with water, until
it lay neat as wax behind her rosy ears. She fastened
the silver arrow amid the braids, drew on her shoes
and stockings, fastened her beautiful apron into place—and
now she was ready.</p>

<p>Groups of wanderers came along the road; many of
them turned to look with pleasure after the young
peasant girl who walked on in her springtime freshness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_993">[Pg 993]</span>
and prettiness, with the light of pious faith in
her eyes. If the bridge had been crowded yesterday,
it was very much worse to-day. There was a running
and a pushing about as in an ant-hill, the air
trembled with the monotonous murmuring of “Sacred
Coat, intercede for us.” One procession after the
other dragged itself slowly over the ancient stone
arches.</p>

<p>“Sacred Coat, intercede for us. Sacred Coat, intercede
for us.”</p>

<p>There was a humming, as of a swarm of bees, a
slow crowding through the narrow alleys which were
gay in festal ornament. There was no house, however
lowly, that did not have some bit of decoration in its
windows, a rug, or a banner, a holy picture behind
burning candles. And almost every window was full
of faces looking down with curiosity, or with pious
belief. The nearer they came to the cathedral the
greater the tumult. In the open squares the merchants
stood before their booths crying their wares: “Rosaries—fresh
cakes here—pilgrims’ staves—new-made sausage—correct
descriptions of the relics in the cathedral:
the Tooth of St. Peter, the Hand of St. Anne,
a splinter and a nail from the Holy Cross—only correct
picture of the Sacred Coat—very cheap, only ten
pfennigs apiece.” The Sacred Coat here, the Sacred
Coat there, whichever way one looked, whichever way
one listened—it was an ear-splitting tumult, a confusion
to make one dizzy. And through the chaos of
colors and sounds, through the dust and the smell,
through the fraud and the truth, the faith and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_994">[Pg 994]</span>
unbelief, there drew, like a guiding thread, the monotonous
murmuring of the processions, the dull booming
of the bells.</p>

<p>Margret was dazed and bewildered. She had bought
a bit of bread in a baker’s shop, and asked her way of
the kindly woman there. Now she stood as if lost in
the middle of the street, pressing her bundle firmly
under one arm.</p>

<p>A new procession came past her; she fell in line with
the last women in the train, and followed along with
them. One of them, praying busily, turned to her with
an unfriendly look: “Praise be to thee, Maria, full of
grace—What do you want, girl?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to the Sacred Coat.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here? This is our procession,
costs us good money. Get away from here.”</p>

<p>The woman pushed her aside roughly with her
elbows. The pious pilgrims passed onward, and Margret
looked after them with tears in her eyes. How
fortunate they were, these happy ones! They would
get there first, the Sacred Coat would give them all its
blessings, and there would be nothing left for her.
And she had a sick mother at home! She ran after
them hastily.</p>

<p>Now she was in the square in front of the cathedral,
but a mighty mob of many thousands stood between
her and the high, gray portals which, wide open
as they were, could not hold the human stream flowing
into them. The beadles in their red garments, with
long staffs in their hands, stood like fiery cherubim at
the entrance to the paradise, and ordered the crowd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_995">[Pg 995]</span>
throwing them into line. The mass moved slowly forward.
Margret stood in the last rows, crowded and
pushed from all sides. Finally the human wall in front
of her gave way in one spot and she slipped through,
not heeding the elbows and shoulders stretched out to
hold her back. She was almost at the portals, but now
there was no further movement, the mob stood motionless.
There was no going backward or forward,
the beadles held their staffs before the entrance. There
was not room for another soul to get in at the door.</p>

<p>The ringing of the bells ceased with a long-drawn
sigh; rich organ notes boomed through the air. The
incense wafted upward. “O vestis inconsutilis.” With
a singing as of angels’ voices, the sounds wafted out
from the church into the sun-bathed air, solemnly soaring
high over the heads of the massed community.
The heads bowed as a ripe field of grain bows under
the breath of the wind; all sank to their knees and beat
their hands to their breasts. “O vestis inconsutilis”
came as in one breath from a thousand lips. Then
there was silence, as all listened. Within the cathedral
the singing had stopped, the voice of the priest
was heard. Then there was silence again. “Now they
are showing the Sacred Coat—now they are touching
it.” Margret heard whispering around her. “Now
they will be freed from all their sins and the sick ones
will be made well.” Oh, those happy ones!</p>

<p>Heavy tears rolled over Margret’s cheeks. She had
wandered so far on her tired feet, and now she stood
so near the door, and yet could not get in to the Sacred
Coat. Bitter sobs shook her breast. A couple of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_996">[Pg 996]</span>
well-dressed gentlemen beside her began to notice her.
“What are you crying for, girl?” asked one of them
in a friendly tone. She was startled at first, then she
stammered: “I—I—I’ve come from so far—from way
up in the Eifel—I got a sick mother at home—Here’s
her shirt”—she drew an end of it out of the
bundle—“I was to touch the Sacred Coat with it—And
now I can’t get in at all—Oh, dear Lord Jesus—and—and—and
now my mother won’t get well at
all.” The gentleman bit his lips and nudged his companion,
who put his hat to his face and turned away.
Then the first gentleman spoke again: “My dear child,
you needn’t cry so. It isn’t at all necessary that you
should go into the church. Step a little this way, now
raise yourself up as high as you can—there, do you
see, inside the church, something red in front of the
altar? That is the Sacred Coat. Now they are moving
it. Can you see it?”</p>

<p>Oh, that was it, was it, that bright red thing? How
clear and sharp the color was, like the girl’s skirt
in the inn. Margret stood on the tips of her toes
and stretched out her hands: “Sacred Coat—My
mother—”</p>

<p>“Shh—” The strange gentleman drew her down
again. “Now, you see, you have seen the Sacred
Coat, and it has seen you; it can hear your voice from
here. Now, you pray the best you can, and when
they begin to sing again in the church, and the bells
toll, then your mother will get well.”</p>

<p>Margret hid her face in her hands. Oh, she could
pray, and she would pray the best she knew how.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_997">[Pg 997]</span>
She prayed until the drops came out on her forehead,
all the prayers that she had ever learned, and gave
them all as refrain the same line over and over again:
“Sacred Coat, O Sacred Coat, make my mother well.”</p>

<p>Within the church the great organ toned out again,
and the voices floated down, “Ecclesia, missa, est.”
Margret rose from her knees with a great and confident
joy in her heart. Now her mother would be well
again. She knew it.</p>

<p>As she looked about her she could see nothing more
of the friendly gentleman. The crowd was beginning
to disperse. And now she discovered for the first time
how very tired and hungry she was. Her knees trembled;
the sun burned down hot upon her, and white
clouds grew up in the sky, as if portending a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>She felt that she must rest a little, but not here in
the hot and dusty city. She wanted to be out again,
past the gates, amid the green; then she could start
on her homeward way refreshed.</p>

<p>She walked back unhindered through the streets by
which she had come; with her last pennies she bought
some bread and fruit. Then she hurried out with her
packages over the old bridge to her cozy willow grove
beside the Moselle. The noise of the city remained
behind her; nothing moved about her here but the
breath of the wind in the bushes, and the hum of the
little blue flies in the air. Every now and then a fish
would spring out of the river and fall back again into
the refreshing flood with a little splash. A dreamy
silence surrounded the tired girl. There was no sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_998">[Pg 998]</span>
of the bells, no human voice, nothing but peace and
rest.</p>

<p>Now she had eaten her bread and fruit, and sat
quietly in the shade of the willows, her head sinking
gently down upon her arm.</p>

<p>She did not know how long she had slept, or even
if she had slept at all; a loud laugh aroused her. The
two gentlemen who had spoken to her in front of the
church stood before her. “Here’s luck,” said one of
them. “One doesn’t meet a little fool like this every
day. Are you much edified, little one?”</p>

<p>“Leave her alone,” said the one who had spoken to
her before. “She’s so pretty. Well, my dear child,”
he said then, and put his hand under her chin, “you
know you owe me thanks. Without me you would not
have seen the Sacred Coat, and your mother would
not have been made well. What are you going to give
me for it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, good sir,” Margret courtesied, and took his
hand confidently, “I thank you many thousand times.
If I knew where you live I would bring you pine cones
to help make the fire, and berries, and I will spin for
your dear lady for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, my dear child”—the gentleman drew
down the corners of his mouth—“but that’s a little too
far off. You might give me a kiss, though, don’t you
think, or perhaps two.”</p>

<p>“And me, too,” laughed the other. “We are good
friends, and we’ll divide even.”</p>

<p>The frightened girl looked from one to the other.
She drew her skirts together with her left hand and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_999">[Pg 999]</span>
held her right arm out in front of her as if for protection.
“No, oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, don’t be so foolish, little one.”</p>

<p>The gentleman’s face was not nearly so friendly
now. He put out his arm and caught the girl in spite
of her struggles. She tore herself loose with a scream,
and sprang back from him.</p>

<p>There was a noise behind them in the bushes. A
tall man stepped out between Margret and her pursuers.
“Let that girl alone”—the stranger twirled a
heavy stick in the air—“or I’ll show you something,
you—”</p>

<p>The two men turned, murmuring something about
a “clown of a peasant” and disappeared.</p>

<p>Margret stood as if rooted to the ground, trembling
in her fright.</p>

<p>The youth reached for her hand. “Come with me,”
he said.</p>

<p>She followed obediently along the road which she
had come the day before. They walked along for a
little while side by side without saying a word. The
girl’s eyes rested now and then shyly on the figure of
the young man. How slender and strong he was!
How prettily his hair curled, and how daring his little
mustache! A deep blush grew up over Margret’s
cheeks; she drew her hand slowly out of the fingers
that held her so gently and stepped over to the other
side of the street. Then they walked on on either
side of the road; a look would now and then pass from
one to the other, shy and timid. The sky was overcast,
the burning sun covered with clouds. The wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1000">[Pg 1000]</span>
had freshened, and was rustling the tree-tops along
the wayside, throwing down showers of leaves and ripe
fruit. The city was hidden behind a veil of whirling
dust; soft thunder grumbled in the distance, the birds
fluttered anxiously and sought noisily for a shelter.
Gray caps of fog drew over the tops of the mountains,
and there was a smell of cool rain in the air.</p>

<p>“There’s bad weather coming,” said the youth finally,
gazing up searchingly at the sky.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Margret. And just then the first
drops fell, heavy and impudent.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“From the Eifel, up there by Kyllburg.”</p>

<p>“Kyllburg’s where I live; that’s fine, we can go on
together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Margret, and breathed a sigh of
relief. She felt quite safe and contented beside her
stately companion. No one could hurt her now, and
she need not be afraid of the night in the forest.</p>

<p>“I am Valentin Rohles. My father is dead; I live
with my mother, but she’s so old now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Margret shyly. She knew the name;
it was one of the best in the town, but she had never
seen the young man before. She had heard the girls
saying how glad they were when handsome young
Rohles came home from the army. But what should
the poor cotter’s daughter have to do with a rich peasant’s
son? What would the girls in Kyllburg say if
they could see how friendly he was now with poor
little Margret? She looked down at herself in sudden
alarm. Was her dress all smooth and nice? Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1001">[Pg 1001]</span>
her clear eyes were raised again in grateful confidence
to her companion’s face.</p>

<p>“I am Margret, from Balduin’s hut. You can see
it from Kyllburg across the mountain.”</p>

<p>“What did you want in Trier? Did you go to the
Sacred Coat?”</p>

<p>Yes, that was it! And now the whole story of
her joys and sorrows gushed out over Margret’s lips.
She was so happy to be able to tell somebody all the
troubles and worries of her heart. In the excitement
of her story she came over from her side of the street,
close up to the young man, and laid her brown, work-hardened
fingers on the fine cloth of his coat sleeve.
“But now it will be all right,” she ended. “Mother
will get well—Oh, the blessed Sacred Coat—” She
laughed aloud in her joy and danced over the rain-pools
in the street light as a young fawn.</p>

<p>She did not notice that more than once during her
story her listener’s lips had curled in a smile that was
mainly good-natured, but just a little mocking. His
eyes looked roguishly down upon her, resting on her
sweet, young face, flushed with excitement. The open,
brown stars of her eyes and his roguish, blue ones met
in a long look. They rested there until the girl, blushing
suddenly, dropped her eyes and the young man
spoke with an embarrassed smile: “You’re a good girl,
Margret. Give me your hand again.”</p>

<p>The rain came down in torrents now. Margret drew
her skirt up over her head, holding it together in front
of her face. It seemed quite natural that the youth
should lay his arm around her shoulder and guide her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1002">[Pg 1002]</span>
steps, for she wandered along half blinded by her garments,
the tip of her nose alone peeping like a rosy
point out of the black cloud.</p>

<p>Evening had come already; the heavy rain-clouds
brought the darkness earlier than usual. The earth
had softened to mud and caught at their feet, but it
was not uncomfortable to walk along in it. The young
man strode out with long steps and the girl’s light feet
tripped merrily beside him. What did the darkness
and rain matter when it was so pleasant to chat together?
A great secret joy grew up in Margret’s
heart, a joy that seemed to run on before her, strewing
the way with roses and painting the gray sky blue.
The whole dirty, rainy world seemed changed into a
shining paradise. What miracles the blessed Sacred
Coat could work!</p>

<p>Hours passed in this way. When they reached the
lonely inn that lies at the parting of the ways where
the Eifel dweller leaves the valley of the Moselle to
climb up into his mountains, they stopped for a rest.
They had been walking since noon. Margret bit with
huge enjoyment great pieces out of a hearty sandwich
and drank long drafts from the glass her companion
held for her. How good it did taste! The fiery country
wine rolled warming through her veins and sank
her into a state of mild delight.</p>

<p>Then when they had rested for an hour, they started
off again. The rain had stopped. The full glow of
the moon shone out behind the torn clouds. The path
became stony and difficult; the streams of water had
torn great ridges in the soft earth. The foot could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_1003">[Pg 1003]</span>
scarce find a hold, and more than once the man’s strong
arm caught the stumbling girl and held her up.</p>

<p>Margret was very tired, her chattering ceased; she
nestled close to her strong companion like a weary
little bird. He led her as if she had been a child, raising
her over the pools and the stones, and saying now
and then comfortingly: “We’ll be home soon.” But
the “soon” stretched out to quite a long time; at the
last he almost had to carry her. Margret went on as
if in a dream. Her eyes were tight shut in blissful
confidence; she thought it would go on this way forever.
She started up almost in a fright as the youth
halted suddenly and pointed out with his hand to where
dark shapes grew up in the gray mist with twinkling
lights here and there—“Kyllburg!”</p>

<p>They took the narrow path that led straight up the
mountain; Margret was quite awake again. This was
the path that led up to the lonely hut on the bare hill-top,
then she would be at home again, she would be
herself again—and the dream would be over. She
hurried on now ahead of her companion, for here she
knew every stock and stone of the road. In her heart
joy and regret mingled and tossed—regret for the
parting with her companion, joy at seeing her mother
again. She had not known that these feelings could be
so mingled before.</p>

<p>Now they halted again. There was the hut, dark
and silent, with a little patch of grass in front of it,
and the tall sunflowers. There was the pump and the
little lean-to for the goat, and over all the silver light
of the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_1004">[Pg 1004]</span></p>

<p>“I thank you many thousand times,” said Margret
softly, and caught at her companion’s hand.</p>

<p>He had suddenly grown very silent; then he said
hesitatingly: “H’m—Say—H’m—The gentleman
down in Trier—you didn’t want to give him a
kiss—But would you kiss me?—What do you say
about it, Margret?”</p>

<p>Half laughing, half in entreaty, he bowed down over
her face. And Margret, timid little Margret, put up
both arms around his neck and gave him a hearty kiss
right on the mouth. Then she tore herself away and
ran in through the door of her hut.</p>

<p>The youth stood still on the wet grass and waited
until he saw a tiny glimmer of light coming from the
hut. Then he said aloud, and with firm decision:</p>

<p>“That’s the one I want.”</p>

<p>Thus Margret’s pilgrimage ended.</p>
